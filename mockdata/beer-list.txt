review/text: A lot of foam. But a lot.	In the smell some banana, and then lactic and tart. Not a good start.	Quite dark orange in color, with a lively carbonation (now visible, under the foam).	Again tending to lactic sourness.	Same for the taste. With some yeast and banana.

More sweet in the mouth, with honey. The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste.	Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils.	In the end some vanilla and camomile note.	In the aftertaste, too.

review/text: According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday.		The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.

review/text: Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet.		Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color with a half finger of fluffy white head. The head fades to a small layer on top of the pour.		Smell: Very light and crisp. I'm definitely picking up the ginger, but it's not overly powerful. There is a slight sweetness from the malt as well.		Taste: Very light and refreshing. The ginger shows up right away and then fades towards the finish of the sip. The finish is malty and bread like. 		Mouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with smooth carbonation and a very dry finish.		Overall: This is a light and refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular. The amount of ginger is nice, but I would have liked to have more going on.

review/text: Bottle says "Malt beverage brewed with Ginger and ginger added" Sounds redundant to me, but lets move on.		Pours a bud light yellow with a tiny white head of small bubbles. The beer is almost as clear as a glass of water with some food coloring in it.		Aroma of light ginger, a very light malt aroma but primarily odorless on the malt side. I wouldn't be completely surprised if there were some adjuncts in here because of the lack of underlying malt flavors. Taste is of a light adjunct lager with a dosing of ginger. Not surprising there. 		This is a light session beer, good for the warmer days of spring / summer. Mouthfeel is extremely light, high carbonation.		Overall decent. This would be great if you were drinking beers on draft at the bar with some friends just hanging out. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out though to drink out of a bottle.

review/text: I'm not sure why I picked this up... I like ginger, and it was reasonably cheap compared to the other beers I was looking at. Pours a pale golden color with smallish head. Nose is largely uneventful, some ginger in there, a bit of pear, but mainly normal lager. Taste is pretty good, bringing a bit more of the ginger to the fore. MF was a bit fizzy, not terrible though. Easy drinker, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Interesting, but I probably won't get it again.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. 		Hazy titanium yellow body (which catches the shadows forming a beautiful mysterious gradient) with an incredibly dense pillow of magnolia cream. Heavy persistent head and rich creamy lacing.		Pale malt, asian pear, and a hint of citrus in the nose. A vaguely tropical lager...		Tastes very much like a well done APA, with a nice balance of pale malt and low hop bitterness. The ginger adds to the refreshing character, but isn't readily detectable at first (lacks any "bite"). Medium-dry finish - very clean and extremely quaffable. I can imagine hibiscus and beets working in small quantities, though I think they omitted those for this version...		Light bodied, pillowy, smooth and moderately carbonated.		Don't go into this expecting a ginger beer (despite its name) as it has little in common with that spicy soft drink. This is a wonderful session ale though, and worth seeking out if you are a fan of light yet flavorful lagers. Would obviously go perfectly with sushi.

review/text: OK, so the only reason I bought this while shopping at Whole Foods was because I've never had a "ginger beer" unless it was ginger ALE...and we all know that's not the kind of "beer" we're interested in on this site! I was very excited to try this one!...		When poured out it looks like a cheapo macro lager at first sight, then the slowly fading head suggests otherwise. The body is crystal clear and is a very light straw color. The head is bright white and slowly dissipates, but is initially quite thick.		Smell is adjuncty, but there are slight notes of honey and some kind of herby thing going on...ginger perhaps? Can't really tell. From the smell there is obviously something different about this beer though. It has a unique spicy smell to it and reminds me a lot of basil, not ginger. I really can't quite place everything that I smell, but it is a very nice aroma. Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a "ginger beer" based on the smell.		The taste is very unique also. It's kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the "spice" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison's Honey Basil ale. There is some definite astringent burn in the upper throat after swallowing that is no doubt from the ginger, but that is the only ginger I can detect with any certainty. It is only slightly hoppy and malty.		This a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer (I could easily drink 2 22oz'ers) but I think it's failing in its claim to be a "ginger" beer because I don't smell it, can barely taste it, and can only really detect the ginger's physiological effects of a warm throat and stomach. So, rating this one is hard; I've never had a ginger beer so I don't really know what one ought to taste like...but then again I can't really tell if I'm tasting ginger here or the combination of other things. So confused. My recommendation to you Caldera folks: ADD MORE GINGER! There's obviously enough of a curiosity about this style to not hurt sales if it was strengthened. I for one could handle it.

review/text: Notes from 6/24		A: Bright golden glowing beer in a moment of clarity with a lively white head of feathery fluff		S: The ginger is definitely there, or am I smelling my Indian dinner? Almost cake-like in its malt aroma, sharply bready with a slight edge of sweetness		T: Nice clear malty throat taste, reminds me of strands of complex sugars and grains, ginger is more subtle than I expected, more of an undertone than a backbone		M: A refreshing light beer feel, like a pilsner or summer ale		D: If this was a sixer instead of a double-deuce, I could see this being a fine picnic pounder		Overall, pretty impressed for the particular style

review/text: 22 oz. bomber,		A: Pours a clear yellow with a mild white head, good retention.		S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume.		T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness/Kolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end.		M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure.		D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.

review/text: Is it possible for a bottle to be a novelty product? I bought it cause it's the only bottle of Caldera I've ever seen, so I guess so. Stoked to be the first to review a beer! That's a lot of responsibility so I might as well give it a thorough review. Poured into my New Belgium Tulip.		A - Clear golden color with a bright white 1" head that slowly fades to a ring around the top. Lacing is minimal, but still there and fighting to cling to the glass		S - Smell is of ginger and honey. Very appealing.		T - First hit is of ginger. Not too strong or biting but just the right amount. Fades to a sweetness on the tongue that is sort of perfect and then... a little bit of bite from the hops making their presence known.		M - Medium bodied and full. A nice round beer for the summer. Not too heavy, definately not watery. Not very good at describing it other than it's good.		D - I really like this beer and I could probably put 2 or 3 glasses away, so one bomber is enough for me. I think 2 bombers would be too much, but I could probably drink one and half, so I think I'll have to stick with the one.		Overall this is a pretty good ginger beer. I think that for my money though, I'd rather buy Trade Route's Ginger Pale Ale. If you've never had a ginger beer, Pick it up.

review/text: Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. 		Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate/coffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive.		Other than that, extremely pedestrian.

review/text: Caldera presents yet another circumstance where the brewery does not operate a brewpub, doesnt bottle their beers, and is located 300 miles from my home. To review their beers I traveled to their hometown of Ashland, OR and drank at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. This may have been a mistake. 			Though I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. 			I will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. 			Till then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.

review/text: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.

review/text: Pours a murky light brown with a 1 inch fizzy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire smoke, etc. Taste is of smoked meat/cheese, campfire smoke, wood, and a slight cocoa/coffee flavor on the finish. The aftertaste is also cocoa/coffee with just a hint of the smoke flavors. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall this is a very good rauchbier from Caldera that has a bit of a different flavor than German rauchbiers.

review/text: A new arrival to the West TN area... 		Pours quite a bit lighter than I was expecting. Almost like a brown ale? Good head retention though...		Smoky bacon aromas upfront mesh with a sweet maltiness... This is definitely very smoky but not overpoweringly so... Its subtle at times and powerful at others on the nose... Like being in a smokehouse after the meat has already been removed... Very interesting...		Sweet caramel malts surprise me as I thought the smoke would hit hard right off the bat... The smokiness here is beautifully done... Not a smoke bomb but rather the smoked meat flavors run parallel to the sweetness darting in and out, here and there...		Very good example from Caldera here. Excellent use of the smoke with its subtleties...

Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison.

review/text: This is my first rauchbier. 	Pours a burnt amber. Good head.	Holy smoked meat! This has huge beef jerky on the nose. Salty smoked meat goodness.	Tastes about the same as it the nose. Wood, smoked meat, cured meat, soy sauce. 	This is delicious for the first 6-8oz, then it gets to be a little much. I imagine after having this a few times, you appreciate the flavors more. Maybe I should've picked a tamer rauchbier to be my first

review/text: A: Pours a rich, ruby color, clear. Maybe a finger of off-white head. Thin cap with thick ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Light lacing.		S: Wow. Smoked meat balanced by caramel, bready sweetness. I wish they would make this smell into a cologne..no shit, I'd wear it to special occasions. 		T: Taste is equally as good. Smoked meat with just a hint of peet. The nice thing about this beer is the smoked characteristics don't overpower the rest of the beer. The caramel, bready malts hold up nicely and there seems to a slightly hoppy finish. 		M: A little on the light side, but it's still manages to be somewhat creamy. 		O: I had heard some good things about this beer and it certainly lived up to my expectations. It's a very well crafted beer where the smoke asserts itself, but doesn't drown out everything else. I'll pick this up again without a doubt.

Smoke, cured bacon, rich caramel malts. More smoke. Ok, maybe it one sided, but it's heavenly. 		Rich caramel malts and salty cured bacon strips. Bacon lover right here, so, I don't feel the need to go on. 		Lighter, but medium in body. feels fine. Nothing tremendous.		Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!

review/text: Pours light caramel brown with reddish highlights. The crisp white head doesn't hang around long, but quickly dissipates to a thin ring.		Aroma is intense meaty smokyness. Underneath is a mild malty sweetness.		Taste is really interesting. The smoked meat quality is retained, but there is also a generous earthy, woody character. Caramel and toffee really round things out. Finishes with a mildly dry cedar character.		Mouthfeel is a chewy, medium body.		A flavorful brew. Strong smokiness is tempered by the rich caramel malt qualities. A real winner that could bring the non-smoke lover around.

review/text: Big thanks to N2168 for knocking this off my wants. Poured into a stone nonic and shared with my buddy Ryan. 		This was quite delicious. The pour made it seem a little lacking in carbonation, and while indeed it was light in carbonation I think it would have been awkward if it had been heavier considering the taste profile. This beer does such a good job of hitting the sweet and savory side of smoke. Nice big campfire smoke smell and taste without any roughness to it, with a nice smoked bacon savory sweetness. This is easy to drink and just downright delicious, would love to have a keg of this by my desk.

review/text: On tap last night at the Caldera Tap House.		Pours a bright and clear brown color, with a small white head.		Aromas are quite potent. Lots of interesting smoke notes here, smoked meat, charred wood, like a camp out in a glass. Very nice.		Flavor is like the nose, but toned down just a bit. Light caramel, bready, and slightly sweet up front. Beer then settles Into a smoke house flavor, hints of charred wood, and jerky.		Mouthfeel is good, full, smooth, but not heavy at all.		Overall, this is a really well made smoked lager. The nose is wonderfull. But the beer turns out to be plenty drinkable, I usually am a one and done with smoked beers, not this one. Another great offering from Caldera.

review/text: 22 oz. Think I picked this up in Chicago Binny's Oak Park.	Solid amber/brown pour, half finger of off white head disappated to a ring, but lasted.		Smoked malt, peat, canadian bacon and some malty caramel. Starting out real well.		Taste, solid dose of smoked ham, bacon, peat and a woodiness. Caramelly malt body is there, almost some faint raisin or apple cider, then finishes with solid bbq.	The real deal, far far and away the best American version I've had of this style. So few try this style, even less accomplish the task.		Lighter side of medium bodied. Coats well, goes down smooth, no alcohol. 7.4 is a little larger than some for the style, but it doesn't show itself.		Best brew I've had in a while. First I've had from this brewery, if their others are even close to as good as this I won't be disapointed.

review/text: A- Semi aggressive pour produces a 1-1/2 finger very light brown head that rests atop a beautiful deep copper colored beer with nice clarity. Nicve lacing.		S- Very similar to a smoked porter but more smoke. The smoke smell is beautiful. It smells like a campfire and the cherry wood is definitely present. Excellent smelling beer. 		T- WOW! They were not kidding on the bottle when they said it has an intense smoke flavor. It is excellent and I could see some folks that the smoke is too in-your-face, but I love smoked beers and I love this one. This is as smoked wood forward as I've ever had. It's pretty much smoky wood, a slight malt sweetness, and finishes woody and smokey again. This is a perfect fall beer. 		M- Nice smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation. 		O- Not too complex because of the intense smoke taste but it works excellent in this beer. I will definitely be picking this up again.

review/text: Look: Burnt orange in color with 1/4 inch head and no retention but did have some lacing		Smell: This beer smells like a campfire in a bottle also reminds me of burnt oak chips or smoked salmon		Taste: The flavor is this beer is quite unique. The smokiness is there in abundance and is pretty much just liquid smoke. Again the taste does follow suite with the noise there is a big smoked salmon flavor		Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carbonation		Overall: If you love the idea of smoked anything actually you will love this beer. It is hands down one of the most smoky beers I have had to the point where it almost looses balance like say Alaskan smoked porter or Ass kisser smoked porter. However if you are into smoked beers this one is a must try

review/text: Bottleshare from Darthkostrizer with BHOBS and Alucard4	Pours a hazy reddish brown with a very quick dissipating bubbly head. No retention obviously. 		Holy shit. Smells exactly like uncooked applewood smoked bacon and/or smoked salmon(not fishy). Very nice yet strong smoke. 		Tastes just like it smells. Very strong different smoky flavor but Good. 		Good carbonation. Smooth and Medium bodied.		Overall at some point in trying this beer You Will Say Holy Shit! It is Unlike any any beer I've had and any smoked beer for that matter. Its very interesting but Good. Although it very hard to drink alot of it. Definitely a bottleshare.

review/text: Amber to yeloowcolored, was expecting darker, kind of even had a good degree of clarity to it. Holy cherry wood campfire smoke! This smelled just like you were out in the woods.		Whoa, I could only take a small sip at first, massive liquid smoke feeling in the mouthfeel. Ugh. Its not so much as 'bad' as opposed to 'challenging'. I must admit, I could not even finish a taster of it. This is the most intense smoked beer I've ever come across, by far. I mean, beer geek bacon was a walk in the park compared to this. 		I could smell it all day. As far as drinking it, I'm cool with 1oz at a time, its that intense. If you like smoked beers, then check this out. If not, stay away. I kind of like them, trying to get into them more, so I'd try it again next time, but for now, I'm not worthy.

review/text: Pours a brilliant black with ruby tones and a 1-finger tan head. Weak retention and lace, as expected from such a malty brew.		The nose is a smoky, malty blast of barbequed pulled pork, woodsmoke and brown sugar with undertones of baked apples and peaches. Nothing over-the-top here- good balance and elegance in the aromas. And I dunno if it's just me and my mental associations, but I could swear I smelled the BBQ sauce in this too.		The palate, much like the nose, is hugely smoky- more bbq and toffee flavors- with a medium-body and a slight creaminess from the malt. The hoppiness is mild while the smoke, naturally, is what lingers on the nice finish.		A wonderful effort overall. I wouldn't go so far as to say world class, but the brew does have a nice bit of elegance which always gets more points from me. And the smokiness carries a lot of power without being too heavy.

Mouthfeel is really smooth, lower carbed tickles the tongue just right, goes down well		Overall its not bad, but as far as a rauch, feels like to much of that peated taste, dont know if I would pick it amongst other smoked beers.

review/text: "Warning, this beer has an intense smoke flavor." Warning...'cuz the flavor may cause me to overdose? I'll leave it at that and hope I don't O.D. off this 22 ounce bottle. On to the beer:		The chestnut colored body is a looker in the stange glass. On top, the head has a beige color, a somewhat creamy texture, several groupings of lace sticking around and retention. The rauch part is done extremely well; mouth-watering jerkied meats stand out above with a little sweetness and a kiss of leafy hop. 		There's a lot of meat on the bones of this beer. Loads and loads and maltiness and medium smokiness make this a winner. The two run in sperate stages and never cross into each other's territory, which in this case I adore. Its got the smokiness that I would find in a summer sausage. On the malty side, there's loads of caramel. Little notes of ash give me the impression that I'm at a campfire. Hints of brown sugar. Alcohol slowly gets noticed, but in a good way; here it brings notes of raisin. There is a moderate hoppiness that can be sensed for a brief second, catch it before the smoke and malt beat it down. On the fuller side in terms of mouthfeel, quite smooth with the bubbles very small yet enough to be felt. 		If I hadn't stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb.

review/text: A-Bright, crystal clear, copper with a medium tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves light lace.		S-Campfire smoke with a subtle hit of applewoods smoked bacon. Sweet caramel malt and spicy pepper notes accent in the background.		T-Yes, this is a smoked brew but it never comes off as over the top. In fact it is about as perfect as it can get. Dry, woody smokiness and spicy, herbal hops dominate. Caramel malt sweetness provides a healthy backbone with tones of toasted biscuit, apple and buckwheat honey.		M-Medium bodied with a feel that is bigger than it really is. Smooth and slick with a drying, woody astringency in the finish. Nice lingering sweet smokiness.		D-Simply put---&gt;OUTSTANDING! Quite possibly one of the finest Rauch beers I have had the pleasure of imbibing! This is a beer I wish I would have tried sooner so I could have gone out and stocked up on. Well done Caldera, this is a beer you should be VERY proud of!

Taste is quite good with smokiness being pungent but not overwelming.	A sweet tasting bock with smokiness coming through around mid drink with a smooth mellow finish.		A good warming smoky beer.

review/text: Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.		A: Clear, dark amber color with one finger of diminishing off-white foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.		S: Sweet woodsmoke is intense, developing fruity and savory complexity that distinguishes itself above the Bavarian archetypes.		T: Begins off-dry, with caramel and sharp woodsmoke that becomes more dry by the middle. Acidity flares early but remains mild overall. Smoke nearly persists throughout, but diminishes by the clean, short finish.		M: Thin to medium viscosity, wet on the palate but becoming a bit too insubstantial, with moderate carbonation.		D/O: This Oregon-brewed rauchbeer develops some of the most intense woodsmoke essence encountered thus far, but it may be at the expense of the strong lager that is its base. Deciphels of the imports from Bamberg would find this beer's intensity surprising--if not off-putting--but it does struggle to leave any impression other than aggressively pungent woodsmoke.

review/text: This beer pours a dark amber color, with a perfect size head that did dispate quickly. The smell is strongly of malts, and a smokyness. The taste starts off very malty, smoked flavors, then finishs with a smoked sausage like flavor. The aftertaste is strongly of a smoked meat; and the flavor stays on your palette for some time, also nicely carbonated. Overall fantastic beer, very odd, but still enjoyable.

review/text: This is the first Rauchbier that I have reviewed. I had it at the Bier Stein in Eugene, OR. 		-a dark but translucent amber with a small head that remains on the edge, with slight lacing in the middle	-aroma: smoked bacon, smoky wood flavor (cherry, beechwood), smoke in general	-medium carbonation	-crisp lager flavor at the beginning that is then overwhelmed by the smoky flavor, some caramel undertones, feels like you're exhaling a campfire	-smoky flavor remains in your mouth indefinitely? My friend could still smell smoke on my breath an hour later on the way home even though I was in the back seat and had a breathmint! 	-leaves a dry, spinach-like feeling in the mouth		The smoke was pretty intense. I enjoyed it okay, but I'll have to try some other Rauchbier to compare...

review/text: Pours a rich burnt caramel hue with some deep amber hues... dark for a rauchbier. a surprisingly dark tan head slowly fades and leaves ample lacing.		aroma is pungently smokey... sweet malt, sweet smoke, and some salted caramel in the nose.		the taste, as expected, is smokey. Not the smokiest or most pungent smoke profile I've experienced, but damn up there. and I think it's the intense rich malt and sweetness from the malt that keeps the smoke slightly tamed. A touch of lemon and citrus fruitiness in the finish which blends perfectly with the cherry smoke.		It's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it. I'm digging it. 		I'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing. I think this is probably my favorite domestically produced Rauchbier I've had the pleasure of tasting. It really hits on all cylinders. A touch sweet and malt forward, but all in all, it does what it's going for and works beautifully. Definitely worth seeking out.

review/text: On draught at The Beer Stein, Rauch r Bock is chestnut brown with a small off-white head that leaves no lace. Nice glow to it though.		Smell is smokey and sweet. Both cherry and beechwood were used, but I'm getting mostly cherry in the nose. 		Taste is really quite smokey, the beechwood really asserting itself here, although the sweetness of the cherry wood and the malt is no slouch either. The smoke has a sharp phenolic quality that I get from peat, but with the sweetness I think it works well. Note it's not cloying, the sweetness is enjoyable and provides relative balance. 		Mouthfeel is slick, some softness, a medium bodied, and smooth. Nice. 		Drinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful. I have to say, this was really good, and with just a touch less phenols, would be up a notch easily.

review/text: Got this in a 22 ounce bomber. It poured a deep bright brown with a pretty small head. 		Aromas of smoked kielba, and dark roasted malts. 		This beer was OK but for a style that I like so much it did'nt really please as much as I thought it would. It had a nice amount of smokiness to it. Really obvious and pretty strong but not charred. But the oily consistency of the beer along with the huge saltiness made the beer less than I was hoping for. 		It was still a beer that I'm glad I grabbed. They don't make many in the style anyways.

review/text: When I'm in the mood for something different from my usual assortment of IPA's I usually reach for a smoked beer like a Rauchbier or Porters. 		Wow this is the mother load of smoked dominance. Nothing subtle about this liquid smoke bomb. Concentrated ash and dried aromatic kindling. Damp Tobacco just adds to the one sided affair. If I had to reach for some balance there is a faint raisin type sweetness buried in the finish. 		Notes: I'd be interested to see exactly how they brewed this beer. The smoke seems more of an extract additive than natural smoke. A bit much for me. However, a 12oz bottle would have been more appealing for one sitting and it has nothing to do with the moderate ABV. Its a rich SOB.

review/text: 22oz bottle.		Pours clear amber with a tight, half inch head of bone. Thin but webbed lacing and a partial skim coat for the duration.		Aromatics lead off with a blast of smoked malts and caramel. Quite meaty and plump with plenty of doughy malt and smoldering wood. Very nice.		Medium bodied with a crisp, slightly tacky mouthfeel. A hint of chew adds some substance.		Sweet malt and wafting smoke start the palate.	A crisp, clean Munich profile is the perfect arena for plenty of Beechwood smoke with hints of bacon and char.		Finishes with unrelenting smoke and rich malt.		Great beer. Loads of smoke and very authentic.

review/text: A - Poured out of a bottle into a tulip glass. Lots of bubbles, almost transparent, rust-red color. No head.		S - Smoky, smoke smoke. Smells like right after I get the BBQ going but before I throw any meat on the grill. I also get a green olive scent at the beginning.		T - Smoke. Burnt wood. Sweet malt at the end. No bitterness at all. I think the smoke mellows out the intense malt sweetness that usually accompanies a bock. 		M - Very crisp, it is a lager after all.		D - A good beer. There are not too many smoked beers made, so for that reason alone I tried it. Well worth it, though it was not my favorite smoked beer.

review/text: Deep cherry body with a faint beige head the recedes to nothing. No cap, no wisp ring, no lacing. Can't say this looks like anything special. 		Smokey and spicy summer sausage is all I can smell no matter how I try. It is however a wonderful aroma that I really enjoy. 		Wow! We have liquid bacon in a glass here! Although initially the cured meat taste is so intense I can't look past it, I was finally able to pick on its other dynamics half way through the bomber. Sweet stone fruits and a touch of orange zest add their nuances to the flavor. Its more complex than I usually find smoked beers to be and I can really enjoy it!		Semi-thin in body with fine prickly carbonation is a nice contrast to such a powerful flavor profile. Anything heavier may have been too much. Finishes clean. 		I found this a little difficult to drink at first due to its uniqueness, but grew accustomed to the pungency. This is a nice sipper if given a chance and I'm really glad I tried it. Recommended.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock glass. 		Brilliantly clear rufous body with faint sienna then amber highlights. A faint yellow-ish beige head persists. Light soapy lacing.		Melanoidin drenched smoked dark brown sugar laden bready malt aromatics. Simple but absolutely entrancing - takes hold of your reptile brain like bacon.		Sweet fruity malty palate entry suffused with delicate layers of smoke. I can't quite tease apart the beechwood and cherry, but the latter adds a bright complexity to the darker tones of the beechwood (which is more standard for this style I believe). Fine smoked ham, pink peppercorn, carmelized winter squash, rye bread, maybe a hint of treacle...at some point the analysis shuts off and the enjoyment takes over. Really well done, the best domestic Rauchbier I've tried thus far.		Light-bodied, moderately carbonated, with low astringency.		I envy anyone who has access to growlers of this - the drinkability is superior as well as the flavor.

Poured chilled from the 22oz into a tulip and snifter.		a - a beautiful bronze color w/ ruby highlights, mild haziness w/ translucent clarity and thin cream cap which settles to a ring of tiny beads of carbonation		S - There is a very intricate aroma of sweet malt combined with woody smokiness. The hardwood aroma is earthy with a slight hint of caramel from the malt and the smoke is very aromatic with a light stone fruit ester in the background		M - The feel is rich with med full body and mild dry smoky texture w/ light bitter tinge and moderate carbonation w/ semi-dry finish		T - I enjoyed the brief sweet perky malt which has mild nutty aspect and slight bready quality. The smoke flavor is moderately strong w/ a mild woody and dry flavor not unlike sweet smoked jerky. The taste has a nice herbal hop complimenting the malt bread crumb taste and caramel w/ a smoke that lasts into the semi-sweet finish		A - a great Rauchbier, one I could enjoy frequently if it weren't such a large bottle, the mid 7% hinders it slightly too, but this was great to share and I loved the complexity of bock malts w/ smoke and smoothness from the lagering. It is a beer I would like to see more brewers attempt, this is a good representative of the style.

review/text: 22oz brown bomber with no freshness date. 		Decent sized head with a faint crackle but still a sticky lace, bright amber color. Smells of wood smoke, dry and not bacon-ish with a thick maltiness and peppery alcohol. Big body, slick and smooth. Yeah, the smoke is big but not over the top ... Dry and almost ashy. Malt stands tall with tones of toasted bread, treacle, dried grass. Mild hopping goes a tad herbal in the finish, a little red in the cheeks from the alcohol. Smokiness lingers far into the after taste.		So smoky, so tasty ... Love the different woods used on the malt. Alcohol is clean and nearly hidden until halfway through the bottle, a big quaff!!

review/text: A: Quite a ruby red hue... deep, rich, almost sporting a soft glow. There's a bit of a sandy colour in the head. Not much for lacing, but the glass seems to be playing a role in that, as it has had a couple different brews in it, all of which laced poorly. 		S + T: I thoroughly enjoy a good rauch, and this one performs quite well in the traditional 'ham and cheese sandwich' sense. It's not overly smoky, which is a positive thing in that it allows some of the other delicate scents and flavours to shine. Of those, I pick up on a light - but noticeable - fruitiness, both in nose and on the palate that seems a little odd. 		worth note: after writing the above, I noticed the print on the side of the bottle to see that cherry wood is used in addition to beechwood. That would explain the fruitiness noted. 		M + D: Body feels a little lighter in the mouthfeel, but seems to pick up a little weight after going down, however little sense that might make. The alcohol content is perhaps a little high, but a little slower sipping never hurt anyone. Not a bad take on the style, though I think I personally would have enjoyed it better if the actual smokiness were a touch more robust.

review/text: Pours dark amber with a short white fizzy head that fades fast.		Aroma is BBQ and smoked pork, some sweet malt and a touch of chocolate.		Flavor starts out like a smoked pork sandwhich, nice smooth lagered finish. Smoke and sweet malt stick in the mouth something fierce. 		A beer that performs as advertised, smoke meat and lager all in one, not really a style I want more than one of but still tasty.

review/text: This beer pours a very clear and attractive shade of ruby brown. Much less dark than I had anticipated, and carrying a diminutive, but attractive head of parchment foam that leaves very nice lace. The smoky aroma of this beer is very nice. It smells like the smoke that would waft from the smoker at a little restaurant in my home town of Traverse City, Michigan. Porky, sweet and delectable with notes of brown sugar. I suddenly have a huge craving for an "all meat mess." The flavor is also quite nice in that the smoke is not too overpowering. Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good. Surprisingly drinkable, and would be great (of course) with BBQ. Not the first smoked beer I have had, but the first I have reviewed. This one makes me want to seek out more.

review/text: 22 oz. bomber, 		A: Pours coppery with a medium head, solid retention, no lace.		S: Beautiful sweet smoke smell, mix of bock malt and wood/BBQ.		T: Not as intense in the smoke arena as Schlenkerla, that's fine. As with the nose, the baked caramel sweetness adds great flavour dimension, with cherry/wood?, mesquite, and sweet BBQ sauce. Really nice interplay of flavours.		M: A tad too light in body for 7.4%, but very smooth, bit creamy.		D: This is the best of the Kettle Series I've had. A very well made rauchbier, in the same league as Schlenkerla a cheaper price. Rare style too. Good job Caldera.

review/text: A nice 'surprise' tap at Bailey's; grabbed a 10 oz. pour ($2.50).		A: Deep auburn with the finest haziness; a brief ivory head (less than 1/2 finger) crests then dissolves. What remains is a broken swirl of film and a creamy ring. Decent streaming carbonation.		S: Lovely of savory smoke and sugared spiciness...a malty, caramel-laden lager covered gently with grainy husks, burnt yet surprisingly sweet. Strong enough to be smelled from 1-foot away in a crowded room. 		T: Toffee and spice (notable cinnamon) with a candied fruit after-effect. Oh yeah, a good deal of smoke - a sweet mesquite, reminiscent of barbecued brisket. Herbed and a little tang in the finish. Enough intonations of fruit and a fleeting tartness.		M: Velvety feel with a slight prickle (less from carbonation, more from an earthy ground spice). Medium body that borders on heaviness (not unexpected: it IS over 7%). Maltiness coats but isn't cloying; smoke doesn't intrude too much. 		D: Despite a heavenly aroma and feel and good flavor, this 'only' can muster a 4.0, simply due to a hefty alcohol girth. It's a touch on the sweet side (ur-bock) but the smokiness is well done. Sure it's worth a glass (or two) and is one I'd definitely have again.

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into a pint glass. I really like cans for beers like pale ales that are not meant for cellaring and am glad to have another one available in SoCal. Cool green tab but sadly no canning or best by date.		Pours a nice rich gold with a pure white head that grows excessively. Slow pour down a tilted glass and cannot even get the whole can into a pint glass. The retention is good, however, and lacing is great. Lots of bubbles cascading upwards from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is mild and consists of a bit of hoppy earthiness and some candied oranges.		The flavor starts with a mild hops bittering and quickly adds a touch of sweetness to balance it out. Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles.		A simple beer, but not really in a good way. This needs some more aroma hopping or some other type of complexity. Long floral/vegetal finishing damages drinkability. Unless one is dying to try a new pale ale, I would not recommend this.

review/text: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!!		Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. 		This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.

review/text: I received this one in a BIF recently and it was the first thing I grabbed out of the fridge when I got home on Friday. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 07/31/2009.		Appearance - One of the best pours from a pale ale you could possibly ask for. Seriously. Big head of white foam on top that barely falls back down to earth. Wonderful clear amber color that really just looks the part perfectly. Lots of carbonation creeping up the glass throughout And a really nice coating of spider like webbing.		Smell - Aroma is lighter then I would have thought. Nice light grains, a touch of piney hops. As it warms a bit of citrus starts to come though, but again, lighter then I would have thought.		Taste - Crisp, clean, the first sip has a biting touch to it as the pine and citrus start to roll through. Nice grains come in mid palate and then it rolls right back into a nice and dry bitter finish. Clean aftertaste leaves you to come back and look for a bit more.		Feel - Light, airy and well carbonated. I had no issue at all with going forward with this one. The feel matched the overall experience very nicely.		Drinkability - Session able, very nice and clean and easy drinking. Again had really no issue at all with putting this one away.		Overall - Solid. Nothing earth shattering here but very solid. I would not mind at all grabbing a six pack and heading to the beach. Really very well done.

review/text: Poured from 12oz can into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Single purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $2.15.		A: Honey-orange with solid 2-finger ivory head with decent retention and only a crown of lace.		S: Plenty of hops in this one with above-average pale malt backbone with leafy and grapefruit aromas dominating.		T: The flavor is good but a touch flat for the style, owing mainly to the lack of character in the maltload. The malt component is not quite sweet or roasted enough, which leaves a somewhat bland quality to this aspect. The hops are highly bitter and pretty harsh: a little more floral and citrus character would blend better with the ambiguous malting. Motwithstanding, this is an above-average APA without a doubt.		M: Feel is a little thin for the style, although not far off with a medium-light body. Carbonation is a bit too short in supply. The aftertaste is very long with bitter and leafy hops notes persisting.		D: A pretty good APA with a big price tag relatively. Solid and highly bitter for the style and could use a little more finesse. Still, enjoyable and didn't last long.

review/text: I wish the flavor bore out the strength of the aroma, which it does not, but still not a bad beer.		Pours a startling straw yellow with a smallish head that falls to nice lacing. The aroma is the strong point - assertively grainy with a crisp hop aroma, mostly grassy with a little flower. I really looked forward to tasting this beer. But it was weaker than I might have hoped, with less of a malt backbone that the aroma suggested and more emphasis on the flowery side of hop character. The bitterness rests, curiously, mostly on the foretaste, with relatively little clinging to the back. The mouthfeel is quite thin, almost insubstantial.		This is a decent beer, but nothing to get excited about.

review/text: I'm really enjoying the variety of quality brews in a CAN i'm finding here in Northern California! this was reviewed while camping at Castle lake campgrounds in shasta city...i think.		 Ooooh yeah, cracking open a can sounds good!! a thick, solid and rocky -white head stands proud like Mt. shasta itself over a bright plae golden liquid, much like the N.Cali sunsets. Retention is amazing, it's not going anywhere anytime soon.		 The nose is just bursting with hoppy cascade aroma's!! Sweet fruits, musty herbs, wheat and corn and light but sweet malt. This all cascade beauty has a great aroma.		 The hoppy flavor's here are deep and very complex, cascade hoppiness all in my face. Light and very, very crispy feel is exciting and spot-on for the style. crisp with a creamy smooth finish from the beastie foam still clumping it's way down slow. The cascade hops provide a gentle fruitiness and perfect dry-herbal and earthy complexity. I havn't been this excited for a Pale ale since my very first Sierra Nevada!!(circa 1996)		 This pale ale in a can has made my day, and I'm camping in one of the most pristine locations I've ever been too. This is simply one of, if not THE best Pale ale i've ever had. Bring on the cans!!!

review/text: 12 oz. can, poured into a tulip.		See-thru deep gold body with a finger's worth of creamy off-white head. Pretty good retention and lacing.		Fairly strong citrusy hop bouquet with a pleasant mild sweetness and biscuity malt. Smells like it will be a crisp, dry brew.		And so it proves to be. There's a bit of honeyish sweetness up front, but it's immediately bullied around by a tag team of citrus (orange zest and grapefruit) and sharp pine needle flavors. There's a bit of earthiness in there, too. 		The sweetness dries up torward the finish as the citrus is joined by some pine needles for a sharp sting of bitterness and a rather 'scratchy' mouthfeel. After a couple of seconds, the bitterness is chased away by a crisp snap of biscuity malt. Carbonation is lively, and the beer starts off as seemingly medium-bodied, but 'fluffs up' in to something pretty substantial. 		Overall impression: Excellent APA. Bold and flavorful, yet incredibly drinkable.

review/text: Pours a deep shade of gold with a fluffy ecru head.		The aroma is biscuity, bolstered by grapefruit hops.		The brew slides across the tongue, nice and oily. Malt and hops hold together in a nice balance, the hops always penetrating but never dominating. A tad sweeter than I'd like with a mild butter profile.		This is a good, but not great, beer.

There's a slight hop presence giving a bit of citrus. It's well balanced with a big malt presence. Nice overall.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated.		Drinkability is fairly high.

review/text: A 12 oz can from Liquid Solutions.		A: The pale ale is appropriately pale, a light golden hue that has more yellow than orange in the mix. The light color has a slight haze to it. A finger of head left dry patches of lace around the mouth of the glass.		S: The aroma is mostly malty, sweet with a thick bready presence. Hops are just below the malts with a less assertive citrus body of lemon and grass.		T: The hops are far more aggressive in the taste, showing off a grassy taste that quickly goes citrus. The hops are agressive, coming close to turning this into an IPA. The malty breads are well-balanced against the hops, especially later in each sip. The carbonation keeps the hop profile lively.		M: The hop profile needs some time to come through. When it does, the hops leave a very nice finish.		D: The full hop profile makes the ale taste bigger than it is. Other than that, this is another example of a good pale ale in a can.

Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less.		A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.

Balance is tilted in favor of flavor hops, with a touch of citrus rind bitterness on the finish.		M: Light in body, great carbonation and a solid finish		D: I will revisit this, especially come camping season

review/text: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around.		Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well.		The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit.		Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated.		Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.

review/text: Pours a clear gold with some amber hues. Three + fingers of white head slowly dissipates to a finger's width of foamy capping with some good spotty lacing. Smells of honey, toasted grain, floral hops, and a touch of citrus. Tastes of citrus juice up front followed by grainy bread and a honey/caramel sweetness with just a touch of butter. Finishes with some dry grass and spicy hop bitterness. Medium in body with gentle carbonation. A tad bit watery in places, but overall balanced, solid, and smooth with a crisp dry finish. A pleasant pale ale that is easy to drink and quite sessionable. Very flavorful, and pretty IPA-ish for a Pale Ale, I like it!

review/text: pours a crystal-clear light golden hue with lemon and straw highlights. A light foamy one-plus-finger has descent retention, fading to leave behind some stellar lacing. 		aroma if light pale malt and fresh clean hopping. Citrus, pine, hints of lemon, grapefruit, orange, and a smidgen of pineapple. a touch of grassiness and a bit of hard to pinpoint spiciness - yeast?		Tastes deliciously hoppy, as a good Oregon pale would be expected to. Citrus leads, followed by a touch of pine and some tropical fruit notes of pineapple and manilla mango. some subtle spicy hops add a bit more depth than the average apa. Just enough light malting to be detectable without coming across malty. 		smooth and clean with a moderate body for a pale and ample clean carbonation to provide a nice finish. a lingering hop bitterness pairs with just a hint of caramel sweetness on the tongue to keep me happy and wanting more.		I've been a long-time caldera fan, and it's become one of my go to APAs - not just from a can. The can is just an added bonus. Unbelievably drinkable, the hops are strong but not overpowering, the malt and sweetness just enough to keep me addicted. Definitely a must-try.

Lots of citrus flavors, grapefruit, lemon, orange & a bit of toasted malt. Very clean & tasty! Can't wait for another sip!		M: Medium-full, kind of oily, moving to a crisp off-dry some what spicy finish.		D: Fantastic drinkability! A huge fan of what Caldera is doing with cans. Awesome for camping/hiking, skiing, fishing, or anything where you don't want the weight of a bottle, but the quality of a micro brew. Easy to pack-in & pack-out.

review/text: Thanks to thirstyhophead, who introduced me to the pleasures of the Caldera IPA, & threw this can into a subsequent trade. I don't dare hope it'll be as good. 		Lovely brew poured into my Lost Abbey chalice, with a nice shade of yellow, not piss-yellow like Bud, but more amber & deeper. Smells like a pale ale. 		This is a nice brew. The flavor is present & accounted for without being overwhelming. I think this would be a superb gateway beer for a BMC drinker - there's not so much flavor to cause anyone to drop their Coors Light & run screaming, but it has enough for us dedicated beer freaks to have a sip & go...mmm. That's nice. The lighter flavor, I've noticed, encourages bigger sips, & I'm trying not to gulp this one down too fast. It's a long night. Pace yourself. 		Did I hear session beer? This would be a great beer to find on tap at the local pub, tasty, easy-drinking, but with a low enough ABV that you're not playing bumper cars in the lot after three of them. That's two very good beers from this mystery brewery. I will stop by if I'm ever in the neighborhood.

review/text: A new beer for the Tidewater Virginia area, Grape and Gourmet had it. 12 0z can. Appearance is pretty average: straw color, fairly clear, small to medium pillowy white head, no lacing, less than average head retention.		Smell is fairly average also, some hops. Tastes pretty good. A malty backbone with some hint of floral and piney hops throughout and a definite hops finish.		Mouthfeel is crisp and fairly rich for the style. Not a watery BMC.		Drinkability is solid. This is a session oriented beer..especially for warm weather. I could do several of these. If we had this one on tap, it would be a real summertime winner.

review/text: 12 oz can into a pint glass. 		Pours a clear gold with several fingers of foamy cream colored head. 1/4 finger of smooth retention stays strong, leaving some good spotty lacing back. The aroma is very pleasant smelling, being floral and a touch spicy with a steady underpining of citrus and toasted malts. 		The taste is citric with some buttery bread and a dab of caramel. This tightens into a firmer bitterness towards the back of the swallow. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an easy and creamy overall feel but I was pleased to find a bit of firmness underneath as well that adds some gravitas to the body. 		Very solid Pale Ale here with a nice tight profile that is solidly drinkable. I'm digging the portibility of this in cans as well. I'm definitely looking foward to more of these.

review/text: Can from Beer Run, Charlottesville, VA, enjoyed on site during Super Bowl Sunday. Poured into a traditional American pint glass that came chilled, so I had to give it a chance to warm and wipe it down.		Appearance: Pours a surprisingly light and transparent golden yellow - I'm hesitant to say urine, but, you know - with an initially foamy two-finger head that fades into a relatively healthy sheen pretty quickly and leaves lots of scraggly, fluffy, cloud-like lacing streaming upwards towards the rim. The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking. A solid start.		Aroma: Buttery, slightly spicy malt notes, cracker and biscuit-like, with a few light fruity esters - perhaps hoppy in origin, perhaps yeasty in origin, coming across as pineapple in places - mingling with some heavier, definitively hoppy citrus notes, and plenty of grassy, spicy notes. Perfectly pleasant.		Taste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale. It's almost cinnamony in places, probably a result of the hop notes. Odd but interesting.		Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and soft, gently carbonated, leading to a very creamy and subtle mouthfeel, a feel which works well with the malt profile on this one. Very very nice.		Drinkability: This was a strange and somewhat unexpected brew. Not quite your traditional west coast pale ale, heavy on the bitterness, citrus, and minty hops with a heavily roasted but still sweet malt backbone to back it up; this one is more heavy on lighter, spicier, grassy hop notes and has a surprisingly light and dry malt foundation. Nonetheless, it's still nice, pleasant, and went well with the first six minutes of SuperBowl XLIII!

review/text: 12oz can into nonic.		Very pale golden hue with a slight haze. A two finger off white head slowly settles to a thin even cap, leaving behind a solid wall of lacing. 		Bready malt tones in the background. The hops provide light citrusy aroma with a light spiciness. 		Slightly sweet biscuity grain flavor sets up a base for a light hop bitterness. A little diacetyl is in there as well. The hops have a light herbal flavor to them. Full bodied. 		Seemed a bit pricey ($12 per 6'er) for what I got. It's a good Pale Ale, and rather sessionable, but for a dollar more I could get Bell's Hopslam or Troeg's Nugget Nectar. Not that those beers are necessarily and better or more desirable, but you get a hyped high gravity beer for a dollar more that an ordinary Pale Ale? Anyway, it's an enjoyable beer. Recommended.

review/text: A: Quite a pale yellowish amber... not pale like something like Rolling Rock, but it's a lighter one, and suitable to the name. A mediocre little white head forms on top leaving little fanfare - some sticking here and there, kinda patchy. 		S: Tropical fruit comes to mind right away... pineapple, in particular - some peach and pear. Surprisingly fruity, but not in an alarmingly sweet sort of way. There's a leafiness to the hops, as well. Kinda like if a canned Dole snack was hopped. 		T: Herbal and slightly citrusy hops. The pineapple-like flavour is there as it is in the aroma. I wasn't sure what to expect from this brew, but it's quite tasty. 		M + D: Kind of lacking in body and carbonation - not flat, but almost "muddy." Something is missing here, though I can't place a finger on what. All in all, it's quite a tasty brew, but the price is very high in these parts (Virginia). They offer reasons as to why they cost more on the webpage, but I have trouble with the reasoning for it. That alone would be the deal-breaker for buying more, unfortunately. If cost of a product is not an issue, by all means, get some - it is good beer!

review/text: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass.		Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing.		The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. 		The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish.		The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales.		This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.

review/text: Thanks to flexabull for sending this for the Survival Football LIF. Poured from can into McChouffe tulip, appears clear light golden yellow. About 2" of thick white fluffy head, settles slowly leaving a rocky top with some thick clumpy lacing. Smell is pretty simple pale ale, a little citrus, subtle earthiness. Taste is lots of sour citrus, a little pine, backed up with just enough malt. Mouthfeel is medium up front, but the finish becomes more oily and resinous, leaving the mouth coated with some lingering sour bitterness. Drinkability is super high, would be easy to down a few of these in a night.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a 20oz imperial pint.		A: Pours a crystal-clear, bright golden color with some lazy trails of carbonation. Capping this was a pillowy, off-white 1 finger head that quickly dissolved to a splotchy skim that left a fair amount of lace.		S: Aromas of spicy pine, mild citrus, and sweet caramel. Pretty simple and very clean.		T: See above. Add in a little toasty malt and a bit more citrus (than what's in the aroma). Again, pretty simple and very clean.		M: Full and pretty oily with a turn towards some dry and spicy astringency during the middle that continues on through the finish. Also finishes pretty peppery.		D: Fantastic drinkability! In this age of extreme everything it's sometimes refreshing to get a hold of something so simple and satisfying.

review/text: I wanted to like this beer. I really did. I love the town it comes from - Ashland, Oregon - and I thought to myself that a place like Ashland must have the creative spirit to produce something unique. Well, this beer was unique, alright. I can't recall ever drinking another beer with a hop flavor like boiled vegetables. Blech! Appearance was average, and head retention was so-so. I noticed no lacing whatsoever. Smell did not reveal what the taste had in store. On first sip, I noticed nothing immediately untoward, but as the hop flavor built so did the unwelcome overcooked-vegetable flavor. I tried another can the next day thinking that maybe I just had a bad one, but with the same result. I'm afraid I won't be trying this one again, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else. You could do worse, but to me this beer would be a last resort before having to accept a macrobrew.

review/text: I bought a six-pack of Caldera Pale Ale at a grocery store. Poured in to a pint glass.		Pours a rich gold color and is ever so slightly hazy. Creamy white head caps the beer and is quite resilient. The head dissipates in ridges and valleys, finally getting down to small islands of foam on the surface of the brew..		Smell is fairly faint. Some hoppy fruity esters perhaps, but generally unremarkable.		Taste is a bitter flavor, like sour citrus. A little malt flavor sneaks in too. Strong flavors for a pale, almost approaching what one would expect from an IPA.		Mouthfeel is light, crisp and clean, but dry. Not watery, but light on the tongue. 		A drinkable pale ale, but I think the sour citrus flavor is a bit over done for the style. I'd have this again though. The packaging (cans) are great for camping, tailgates and the like, but it's a bit overpriced in my area at $8 a sixer.

review/text: Yum! I really love these canned craft brews. It's really a great way to package beer. It's fresher, doesnt get oxidized or uv-damaged, cools faster, and is so much easier for camping, events, etc. 		Golden color and slightly chill hazed. Decent head, but it falls away kinda quick. 		Aroma is a bit disapointing. It's really kind of mild. Some floral and herbal sweet hops, then some dry caramel malt. 		Really makes up for it in the taste! Rich grapefruit and sour lemon. The bitter citrus flavors of orange and some tropical fruits in there too. A tad of toasty honey sweetness to counteract it. So drinkable, and so tasty.		I was down in Ashland the other month, but these guys only do dock sales. Ill be stopping by next time for a case.

The aroma was semi sweet malty smell with some pine hopiness jumping into the nose. It had a powerful aroma for a pale ale.		Taste was good. It has a bread malt up front with a moderate hop feel on the back end. In the mouth it had a good sharp bite on the finish. Overall a good solid local pale ale.

review/text: Thanks to flexabull for this in the UGLY BIF. Gotta love craft canned beers.		Pours a pale yellow color, slight opaqueness, good sized head with a little retention layer and a little bit of lacing.		Smell is stronger than I would expect from a pale ale, strong citrus and grapefruit aroma with hops, makes me think it could almost be an IPA if some more hops were added.		Taste hits with the hops and citrus first, leaves an interesting bitterness in the mouth, not quite good but not quite bad, carbonation is just right and it goes down crisp and smooth, I could see this being an easily sessionable brew if it was available in Maine.

review/text: Slightly dinged-up 12oz can purchased at Bottles in Millwood for $1.69.		Poured a slightly bronzy gold color with two fingers (and I have big fingers) of creamy white foam. The head stuck around for a while, and left lots of streaks, spots and "globules" (as Nigel Tufnel might say) on the sides of the glass.		Piney hops and mildly sweet, caramel-ish malts make up the nose. Seems like Caldera's taking a west coast approach to the style.		Not as hoppy in the taste as I would have thought in the smell, but not to an underwhelming degree. Piney hop flavor melds with caramel malts. The balance is pretty good, with the hops winning out, but not enough to make it an IPA. Mildly dry at the swallow.		Medium bodied, with a slightly slick mouthfeel.		Not a world beater, but a pretty good example of an American pale ale. Not quite good enough for me to shift from my stand-bys for the style, but if this is what's available, I wouldn't shy away from it.

review/text: Vacationing in Oregon. Little bottleshop has Oregon brewed cans in the fridge. Worth checking out.		Very nice floral hop aroma. Lots of cascade with the underlying citrus aroma. Nice little caramel malt aroma but it is definitely hop dominant. 		Golden but cloudy. Pours with a thick pure white head that ends up as a half inch layer of rocky bubbles. Just a little bit of rising bubbles in the glass. Pretty good lacing. 		Nice caramel malt flavor right off and then it has a good hop bitter bite. Mostly grapefruit citrus hops. Can says that it is all cascade so that makes sense. Finish is also some caramel malt flavor. In between there is some oily hop flavor too. Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in a west coast PA. Hoppy but with enough malt that it isn't unbalanced. 		Medium bodied with a good medium carbonation level. Not heavy at all. very nice on my palate.		Very nice beer. I wouldn't rave about to my beer geek friends it but I would be happy to have it as a regular in my fridge. Solid everyday drinking type beer.

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into a nonic, the Caldera Pale Ale is a golden yellow with a moderate size, very tight white head that's long lasting and leaves thick hunks of lace. This is honestly the first time I've ever not drank this beer from the can, and I'm pleasantly surprised with how pretty it is, particularly the paler golden color and chunky lace. I couldn't ask for anything else from a Pale Ale. Served at fridge temp.		Smell is bright, flowery, lime scented cascades and toasted biscuit, perhaps a bit soapy.		Taste is malty, caramel and biscuit, with tart citrus hops, classic grapefruit providing a bitter finish. 		Mouthfeel is very creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. 		Drinkability is pretty good, cascade fans will enjoy this, a bit thick for my taste, but bonus points for the can, which has made this a trusty friend on those cold Mt. Hood chair lifts!

review/text: Clear golden-orange color with small white head that laces well.		Slightly sweet and spicy toasty grain with some floral and slightly woodsy and fruity hops.		Lightly toasted and sweet fruity pale malts perfectly balanced by orangey citrus and floral hop bitterness that's a bit persistent.		Nice light-moderate body that feels even easier due to the high, but no too stingy carbonation. Extremely drinkable Pale that I would definitely buy again.

review/text: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.

review/text: What a classic pale ale, sent courtesy of unclejedi via the CEO BIF!		And in a can, too! Poured a clear amber, mixed together with a golden hue. Sheets of white lace clung to the sides, excellent.		Lite floral and citrus in the aroma, progressing into the taste  which added pine and a squeeze of grapefruit. Sharp, crisp and dry  this would be an excellent on the go brew for any outdoor activity. Hats off for this one!

review/text: Had Dale's Pale Ale for the first time yesterday, and thought I'd compare it to this, both of which i picked up on a recent road trip.		At first glance this beer is a bit lighter than Dale's but remains a very good looking beverage, pouring a slightly hazed golden color with a large white head that lasts a while and leaves very impressive lacing. 		Nose is very hoppy and bitter, quite a bit of citrus noticeable. More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. 	Body is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. 	Final verdict? Another extremely drinkable brew, and another fantastic canned beer for my forays to the pool or wherever glass isn't allowed/convenient.

review/text: Thoughtfully provided by flexabull--thanks! Re-review: Now on my second shipment thanks to unclejedi. Thank you men, and thank the heavens for trading!!!!		Served at about 35F from a 12 oz can into "Boston Lager" pint.		Aroma after cracking open the can is all floral hops.		Pours light, color is golden and crystal clear, with a fluffy white head that leaves good lacing.		Aroma is sweetly malty with strong herbal/floral hop tone.		Flavor is a bit resiny, lots of hops for a pale ale. Strong, filling bitterness.		Great mouthfeel, goes down easy, but the sharp bitterness lingers. A bit unbalanced--just how I like it--the XPA style. Upon re-review I like it even more than the first time I reviewed it. 		This is a fantastic pale ale, my #1 can beer. Looking forward to trying Caldera IPA as soon as I can hook up a trade.

Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA.		Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth.		Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. 		I love canned craft beer!

review/text: The first I am trying from the great trade with msbulldog. (for those of you who don't know him, trust me, he is "the man") ha. 		Popped the tab on this one to a nice hsss! The pour was what I consider above average and but the appearance was just about average. Just a skimming of head with nice carbonation. A very little lacing lasted throughout the tasting.		The typical pale ale smell. I really enjoy this and now think that this should be a candle scent. Or possibly a scratch-and-sniff sticker would be nice.		The tastebuds where not complaining about this interview they had. The canning does not appear to take away from the true pale ale taste at all.		A little slimy and light as this brew went through the ole beer guzzling chamber.		Overall a nice A.PA. that will have to enjoy again in the future. Maybe next time I will go full bore on this one and just shotgun it. Or not!

review/text: Although my can sloshed about (it was short-filled and measured exactly 11 ounces), it didn't seem to affect the flavor or carbonation. I noticed no oxidation whatsoever. It poured a just-slightly-hazy golden body beneath a short head of frothy white foam. The head dwindled down to a creamy surface covering, and then shrank away to a wide collar and whispy surface covering; leaving behind tiny-spotted walls of lace. Bright hops, sweetish malt, and yeasty fruitiness greeted me in the nose, expressing soft citrus, sweetish grainy malt, berries, and cut-grass. It's soft carbonation and medium-light body left it remarkably smooth across the palate. The flavor delivered a rich maltiness upfront that wasn't quite caramelish or toasty, but headed there; followed by an influx of grassy and citrusy hop flavors; and then some berry-like fruitiness at the swallow. The bitterness roses up strong, and although some sticky malt lingered in the mouth, it was bitter, dry, grassy and spicy in the finish. It lingered momentarily with some strength, and then faded to a dull bitterness, leaving me ready for another sip. Quite the little charmer, I say! I love the flavor transition from quaint, sweetish, straight-forward and non-caramelish maltiness, to bold, grassy, citrusy, and bitter hops!!! The apple-ish and berry-like fruitiness is just the icing on the cake that ties the two together. Well-balanced with a very nice complexity and full character, and still not overdone. Worth trying!

review/text: Wow...when was the last time I drank a beer that came in a can.	As tempting as it was to drink from the can, I poured it into a glass instead.	Pretty crystal clear pale yellow with a half finger head that melts to respectible side sticking lacing.	Aromas are bright and floral...with a little of the sweet malt coming through.	Taste is amazing...although a bit thin....there are lots and lots of fresh citrus and pine hops in here. Not a NW Hops flavor...more of a German or Czech hops flavor. A nice peppery bite on the tale end that finishes to a pleasant clean drying.	Wish this was available in So. Calif...would love to pick up sixers of this for the beach, river, lake, park, neighbors bbq, etc.	For me, it is very deceiving being in a can and then poured into a glass I am looking at something that should have a BMC feel or taste.	It doesn't.	This is a wonderful summer craft beer.	Thanks David for the opportunity to try this.

review/text: Presentation - 12 oz. can, simple classy labeling with some info about the beer, including the fact that they use whole cascade hop flowers and extolling the virtues of the can. I'm all about the canned craft beer movement - bring it!		Appearance is crystalline straw color, very light amber. Definitely meets the pale criteria. Not much head, and it dies down quickly, though there is a constant stream of bubbles and some nice sticky lace.	Nose is fantastic, a huge whiff of those cascades mentioned on the can. Juicy aroma for sure.	Flavor doesn't live up to the nose. The malts to back up the hop flavors are lacking, so this ends up being very dry. Decent hop bitterness, but not a very distinctive hop character. Lacks the roundness of some of the better pales.	Mouth is decent, pretty light with some brightness, but with enough body.	With a little more malt presence, this would have the balance that is the main thing detracting from its drinkability. As is, it's a fine beer, but one at a time is plenty.	Not bad, but falls far short of Dale's Pale from Oskar Blues.

Great flavor-well balanced between a good level of bitterness and the malt. Really good hop flavor to it as well as the bitterness. Good body as well. Very, very drinkable beer.

review/text: A: I don't know how everyone else got such a nice head, my pour got me nothing but a thin white white head that was gone in seconds. Gold in color with a few bubbles rushing to the top. Hardly any lacing. 		S: Well what the beer was lacking in appearence it made up for in smell. A very nice balance of bitter hops and sweet malt. 		T: Starts off very, very bitter, so bitter it threw me off guard. It's okay because it has a very strong sweet malt to even out the bitterness. The aftertaste is back to being very bitter. This is exactly what I look for in a Pale Ale. 		M: Medium bodied, very smooth, good carbonation. 		D: Very solid pale ale and one of the best I've had. I thought it was strange that it came in a can, but it doen't effect the flavor in any way. In fact I have been convinced that craft beer in a can is a good thing as it makes it very easy to pack around, this is perfect for summer when you're hiking, rafting, camping, etc.

review/text: In pursuit of the perfect camping beer: Pours (only for review's sake) a deep golden, almost copper with active carbonation and a lovely white foamy cap. Bubbles like a high life, but the foam stays.		Aroma is like a British IPA - grassy and hoppy with an aged malt, almost hully smell. Rather bold aroma from a canned beverage.		Taste is a little too bold - resiny hops dominate the pale malt body and a bitter aftertaste is a bit strong. There's still a great malt body to the ale though, and some sips give you a better sense of it. Still, it is likely to create more of a thirst than quenching it, so fair warning to campers.

review/text: Got a can of Caldera Pale Ale from a neighbor that collects cans, but did not really like the beer. You have to love a nice pale ale in a can. The beer is a cloudy yellow with a nice head that fell after a couple of minutes. The smell is very malty for a APA and has a nice hint of floral hops. The taste is very well balance between malt and hops. Not overly bitter or hoppy, but right on for a pale ale. This a a very good interpretation of the style and unique with the nice malt presence. Mouthfeel is on the medium side and the drinkability is good a well. This woould make a very good session beer if it were regularly available to me. I would definitely recommend this beer if you are looking for an above average pale ale.

review/text: Craft brew in a can. There's probably a reason why it's not done often. Let's find out.	 Pours a pretty soft golden color topped by a half-inch or so of creamy white head that subsides rather quickly. Not a whole lot of carbonation after the pour. Appealing aroma of lightly sweet malt, floral hops, and a touch of fruit and caramel. Palate is well-balanced between light caramel malt and some fairly assertive floral hops that yield a nice, crisp, bitter finish. Body is nice and smooth, making for an easy-drinking beer. Feels like a great accompaniment for a warm evening on the porch.	 I guess this isn't the most challenging beer, but it's still pretty tasty and accessible to those who may be looking for an alternative to Natty Light while fishing. The can doesn't seem to alter the flavor very much. I have to say, I'm impressed with this effort.

review/text: Dark honey with the slightest suggestion of orange. The attractive, cream colored head looks to be high in hop oils; at least I hope so. The glass residue is so fine and spider web-like that it resembles actual lace. Drinking this beer out of the can and missing an appearance like this should be a criminal offense.		The nose is outstanding (see 'drinking... can... criminal offense' above) and puts a huge number of IPAs to shame. The pithy pungency of the Cascade hops fairly leaps out of the glass, with the overall aroma made deeper and more interesting by a much lesser quantity of spicy Perle hops. Great job Caldera. Even if the flavor is on the pedestrian side, the nose is a world-class sprinter.		The flavor doesn't measure up to those stratospheric heights, but that's not to say this isn't a deliciously hoppy pale ale. Emphasis on hoppy. The brewers made sure their beer would last a good, long while by packaging it in light-rejecting aluminum and by adding an impressive amount of hops. Sweet, spicy and juicy white grapefruit is front, center and back. I love the slight variation on the usual Pacific NW flavor profile that the German hops provide.		APAs don't need to be complex to suit me (this one isn't), they just need to be bursting with pale malt-supported bitter hoppiness (this one is). There's enough sweetness on hand to keep things kinda, sorta balanced from a hophead's perspective, although the pucker factor is still decidedly high. The mouthfeel is light-medium and perfectly carbonated; the better to down a few cans on a hot summer day without a second thought.		Caldera Brewing Company is anything but a household name (unless one lives in Ashland, Oregon or its environs), but this little brewery has just provided me with the best beer that I've ever had out of a can. I was tempted to say 'that I'll ever', but ever is a long time. I do know this, it's unlikely to be topped for a very long time.

review/text: Comes in a 12 oz can, simple silver with a calderon surrounded by hop leafs on the front.	In appearance it is a slightly hazy dark golden almost orange coloured ale, good sizeable chunky/frothy off white head, excellent lacing.	Has quite a hoppy aroma to it, but also smells very fruuity almost like red apples.	Nice hoppy bite to the taste to start off, then it gets rather tart and citric, after that it gets sweeter ..like sweet apples and as the mouthful finishes it smooths out to mellow.	Good on the palate, quite "eventful"..nice mellow aftertaste.	Very good drinkability to this one, great for camping which is were I had this beer at Beverley Beach State Park on the Oregon coast

review/text: 12oz bottle into pint glass.		Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with off-white head. 		Nose gives off notes of mango and grassiness with honey maltiness.		Taste is mellow and spicy with notes of date and dried plums. Grassy and green hop presence with smooth bitterness. 		Moderate carbonation with a dry finish and lingering bitterness. 		Overall a nice pale ale that has a well-rounded (albeit bitter) flavor profile. Not as full-bodied as others, but good nonetheless.

review/text: Picked this can up at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa this past weekend. Was really impressed with Caldera's IPA and wanted to sample some more of their offerings. Plus I'm a sucker for canned craft beer.		Pouring into a New Glarus pint glass. Golden-orange hued with scant haze. Thin off-white foam formed atop the glass, slowly receded down. Lacing left behind and foam sticking around. 		Classic citrusy hop aroma springs ahead in the nose with a biscuity and slight caramel malt playing supporting roles. 		Upfront citrus hops with a bready malt in the middle. An herbal/minty hop quality helps round out the hop profile lending complexity without muddling the balanced flavor. Medium to medium-high level of bitterness that maintains its posture into the dry finish. 		Medium-light in body with a moderate carbonation. Smooth. 		Overall another solid offering from Caldera. The nose and initial flavors are classic American Pale Ale citrusy hops. Bready and biscuity malts form a foundation and maintain balance while herbal and minty hops lend interesting additional complexity.

S: refreshing, sweet, fruity hop notes...aromas of citrus with a bit of floralness mixed in...very pleasant...		T: tough to compare as I had Zombie Dust tonight too.. This is ab it flatter than I'd like, kind of a weird dry, bitter back to the end that takes away from the possibility of enjoying any good hop presence... a fairly basic pale...		M: medium to lighter bodied beer that has a nice feel for the mouth... kind a hugs the palate on the way down. nice.		0: nothing crazy. not the worst, and not the best I've had. but at least worth the try. probably wouldn't buy a 6 or 12 pack...

review/text: 12oz can poured into a pint		Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.

review/text: 12oz can into a Duvel tulip. No date, but I know it's at least a few months old as I got it in an in-person trade at DLD and forgot about it in my fridge until today. Oops.		A: A fairly fast pour results in two fingers of lusciously creamy off-white head perched atop a hazy orange body. Solid, rocky retention and lots of frothy lace. Quite nice indeed.		S: The hops have certainly faded, but still lend a nice bit of spice on top of the pure caramel malt. Simple, straightforward, balanced, and pleasant.		T: Follows the nose, but with a bit of extra hop bitterness on the finish; lightly resinous. Very tasty, classic pale ale. 		M: Medium body, lots of carbonation. A little bit too frothy, but not bad at all.		O: This is an eminently solid APA as it is, and I'm sure it would have been even better fresh (I've bumped it a half point to make up for my own foolishness in letting it sit for so long). I'd love to take a sixer on a camping trip. Craft cans FTW!		Cheers!

review/text: Poured into pint glass from can		A: Glowing orange/amber color with white head that has subsided to a frothy ring. Nice deep color for a pale ale.		S: Light aromas of citrus and floral hops with bready and caramel malts. I'm also getting aromas of something similar to yogurt, sort of that lactic sour smell. 		T: Biscuity malt, almost lightly nutty, with floral and grapefruit flavored hops mixing in well. The hops are present but never push the malt flavor out. Bitter-sweet aftertaste.		M/O: Crisp, refreshing, highly drinkable. It's hoppy enough to more than please for a PA and light enough to keep it easy on the palate. Light-medium body with good carbonation. Without a doubt one of the best pale ales I've had.

review/text: Poured from can (love it!) into Deschutes Becker style pint glass.		Pours true pale ale hue, straw core, light head fading to pretty decent clinging lace.		Smells of hops, though of a more subtle style, some malts, and a hint of the yeast. Kind of fresh and inviting.		Tastes of pale ale malts, some good hops, nicely green yet subtle. 		Texture is spot on, great balance, superb finish. This beer really starts shining once you swallow the sip.		Overall a good Pale Ale, and one that deserves a mention among Mirror Pond, Full Sail, and Lompoc. I can't really think of any pale ale that is really much better.

review/text: Orange-yellow in color with perfect clarity and a big foamy white head on top. Excellent retention and lacing. Estery and fruity on the nose, soft citrus mainly. Oranges or tangerines. Light citrus and pine hops as well.		Well balanced in the taste. Citrus and pine hops dominate the taste buds, but balance themselves out nicely to create a drinkable and hoppy pale ale. The bitterness comes on at first like its going to be overdone, but then backs down just at the right moment to make for a very nice sipping experience. Tangerines definitely make their way into the taste as well, not tangy at all, just sweet and estery. Easy to drink and heavy enough for the hopheads, yet soft enough for every one else. Long dry finish, hoppy til the bitter end, leaving a nicely pleasant bitter aftertaste. Decent beer, no complaints here for trying it.

review/text: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here.		Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.

review/text: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. 		Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. 		Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. 		Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. 		Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.

review/text: Good pale ale.		Out of a can is a novelty. Made this and a few others a great choice for craft beer golfing fare.		Tastes great. Lots of grapefruit and pine notes, but it's the stoutish chocolate backbone that makes this a real winner. Far more earthy than some other, more popular pale's out of bottles nonetheless. Very tasty. Will definately revisit.		Drawbacks... not many... a little sour in the finish when the choco and malt dissapates.... could also be the can talking here... but regardless this is one dam^ fine pale ale.		a little pricey around here at 10.99/six doesn't help either... sure it's less near the source....		will take it for another round soon.

S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges.		T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph.		M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems.		D/O- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.

review/text: Poured into a small snifter.		Slightly hazed and the color of sunshine, with a honking cream-colored head of froth that drops slowly, leaving film in big walls on the glass. 		Snappy nose. Grass, lemon  lemongrass! Also get biscuits, honey, a tiny bit of cracker malt and hints of earth. 		The flavor improves on the noses maltiness with biscuits and a pale cracker finish. The bitterness is a bit too light  I get some lemon peel and maybe some German spice as well, but I could use more hops. The finish is cleanly malty, and I get a flash of uncooked malt at the swallow  almost like a handful of dry pilsner malt. 		Medium-light body with very light massaging carb and soft fizziness. Clean, light and drinkable  great for a hot day. 		Calderas pale ale would be great on the golf course. Its flavorful yet sessionable. More hops would help bump this one up to the next level.

review/text: Purchased in Virginia Beach. Poured from a 12oz can into a perfect pint glass. 		Pale orange/yellow in color, the pour cause a sweet 2 fingers of pearly white head to form. The bubbles stuck around for a while before slowly dissipating, leaving behind tons of lace.		The nose is grainy up front...lots of grass mixed with hops. Corn and caramel malts are in the background.		While the caramel malts play a background role in the nose, they take front and center in the taste. Sweet and almost chewy, the candy corn middle fades slightly while the bitterness of the hops finish things off. 		The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, moderate carbonation and a little slick.		This is a pretty odd beer...has hops that are not in the flavor...the taste has the flavors of a (weak) barleywine, but the body is not there...but overall, this is still a tasty offering.

review/text: Can to Sam Adams PP glass.		A: Pours straw-colored with shades of orange and some chill haze. Carbonation looks good, and the head/lacing are on par for an APA.		S: Pleasantly surprised by the quantity of hops, for a Pale Ale I get lots of grassy, earthy hops, some citrus, a crisp sweetness and some malt backbone.		T: More balanced than the nose, the malt subdues the hops somewhat but the crisp bitterness is really the thing that hits first. There is some pine in there, and maybe some ginger. Still hop forward in a nice way.		MF: Crisp and prickly with carbonation, refreshing and light and wet.		O: Pretty good, a nice summer beer that should be sought out to try.

S- Very faint aroma... Almost a white grape juice smell with some biscuit. Smells crisp but otherwise a bit light		T/M- Very bready with nice crisp bitterness... Fairly light flavor, little fruityness hidden throughout. The hop flavor isn't where I would like it, but still a solid PA. Body and carbonation are pretty average for style...		O- Refreshing on a hot day. I tend to be love/hate on pale ales, but this one actually is fairly middle of the road for me. Would buy again to take where bottles can't go or something, but other bottles pale ales are available...

review/text: Pours a hazy dark golden yellow color with a frothy three finger off-white head that has excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. The glass is left coated with large rings and chunks of soapy lacing.		Earthy aroma with floral, piny hops as well hints of grass and straw all balanced by a sweet citrus presence. Pale malt underneath.		Medium bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that is slightly dry and not overly bitter. Earthy and floral with hints of pine needle balanced by some sweet citrus, especially grapefruit and orange peel. Slightly creamy presence with hints of earthy grass and straw as well as a pale malt backbone that balances things out nicely. Fuller bodied and more complex than the average pale ale while remaining light and very quaffable.

Two finger white head that sticks around a while. Good lacing on the glass too.		S: I don't take much from the nose. Mild, if any, hops. I guess it is more malt from the nose? Some florals?		T: This is mild up front, a little bit of hop bite in the middle and a nice good crisp finish. I like this for a pale ale. More of an IPA taste and hop character. I was surprised!		M: This is somewhat watery, but there is some coating there. Doesn't stay too long though.		O: I like this overing from Caldera. The IPA is better conceived, but for a pale from the can....very well done. I'd have again. Comparable to Victory Headwaters which is a favorite in the pale ale catagory.

review/text: From a can, pours straw gold with thick white head; aroma is pine and sugar, some citrus but mostly pine. Taste is fruity, citrus, tea, slight pine, toast grain. Mouthfeel is spot on, carbonation is medium, this brew is quite refreshing! Definitely something I wanna buy in quantity to go camping with this summer!

review/text: Thanks to schmoopsbeer for sending this can out my way. Served in a tulip.		Pour yields a transparent golden-hued brew with a good off-white head with some large bubbles of foam. Good staying power and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is light and grassy with some citrusy hops coming through on the back-end. A bit of tangerine, as best as I can describe. The flavor profile is a bit grainy at first, followed by some grassy hops, and then there is a touch of bitterness in the finish. However, there is some grain tannin there as well. Not terribly pleasant. Light body with moderate carbonation. Can't get past the graininess of this. Not all too drinkable.

review/text: 293rd review on Ba	Can to Pint		App- Light yellow with light orange highlights. A one finger head that was medium length of time sticking around. Nice lacing as well.		Smell- Very basic of wheat, hops and some lemony citrus.		Drink- Crisp, clean and well balanced. A nice wheat base with some crisp malts and a well done chewiness.		Mouth- A medium body with a medium carb level. Nice bigger body for a small ABV beer.		Drink- I feel this was a good beer. Should have checked out Caldera a long time ago. This is one of those beers that was a good way to start the evening. I would have this again during the summer for a nice beach day.

review/text: I love cans. They pour great, don't let light in, and confuse the hell out of people when you bring them places. 		L. Pours a big head, but it vanishes quickly. Thin body with some carbonation but not much. Kind of reminds me of Sierra Nevada which has always been pretty low on my pale ale list especially on looks. Golden with a touch of copper in appearance, perhaps a HAIR darker than sierra.		S. Suble hop kiss, and caramel malt. Some sweet fruity amber malt as well. This smells a bit less sweet than their amber but otherwise seems the same. The IPA smells a lot better.		T. Sweet with some english/american grassy hops. These could be american hops but there's something very english tasting here. The hops finish with enough bite here which the smell and opening taste don't seems to hint at. 		D. Goes down easy and would be great on a hot day. 		M. A touch light on the carbination. As a result the hops have an almost spice like effect, the body isn't thick or syrupy, but is a very dry finish. I like this but there's something here that's a hair off. 		16 dollars for a 6 pack of cans. Thankfully I talked the guy at the store into letting me buy a single but at that price this is a JOKE. At 8-9 bucks a 6 pack, this would be a great summer beer and be worth while all the time. At 16 I just can't imagine ever even considering this beer again.

review/text: 12oz can.	A) Pours with a finger thick, white head that takes awhile to settle. Slightly hazy body. Active carbonation. Gold in color. Nice sticky lacing on the drink down.	S) Pink grapefruit. A hint of evergreen.	T) The initial flavors are washed out by the fizz. Once beyond that some dry nutty-ness liken to walnut. Grapefruit rind. A mellow sweetness throughout but not the main stay. A nice hop bite in the finish, but seems a bit too much for a pale ale.	M) Quite fizzy. Medium body. Dry.	D) A decent brew. I'd have another.

review/text: Well balanced between caramel maltiness and citrusy hops, this beer exemplifies the Pale Ale style nicely.		An expected deep golden to light copper color does the beer pour. Froathy head character amounts to an inch or so before settling it's white lace on the glass. Good retention, but great on lacing. A classic Pale Ale appearance.		Caramel, spice, and hops blend in the nose for the impression of graham crackers, orange rinds, and a touch of ginger. Very appealing aroma that doesn't let the hops nor the malt gain precidence.		Sweet maltiness sets the tone for taste with a medium caramel flavor, cracker-like breadiness, and a light grainy or crusty taste that gives a slight bite that ushers in the hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, orange zest, and light grassy notes peak through early, but grow in intensity until the malt sweetness waivers, giving the finish and aftertaste a decidedly bitter ending to an otherwise balanced beer.		Malt sweetness gives a fuller, rounder sensation to the mouth, while the hops and moderate alcohol provide a drying and crispening finish. Though not complete in dryness or crispness in finish, the beer holds onto enough malt character to attempt balance deep in the finish and aftertaste.		With relatively low/no flaws in execution, the recipe formulation leads to a somewhat one-dimentional caramel malt sweetness that wears on the palate and hurts the sessionability of the beer. And with the standard malt/hop balance, there's not much intrigue to keep me comming back.

review/text: Have had this (and other Calderas) a number of times; this 12 oz. undated (but fresh then) can was a leftover from a buddy's 40th a couple weeks back. Poured to a pint.		"Live Product: Keep Cool, Just Like You"		Around the lip: 	"Go Skiing - Go Fishing - Go Snowboarding - Go Biking - Go Rafting - Go Cans"		A: A glassful of golden sunshine on a dreary day; glowing maize with modest carbonation and a fine dusting of unfiltered-ness. Terrific head: a finger-and-a-half of white fluff that cracks slowly and breaks down to a concave cream. Slender icicle bands of lace.		S: Pleasant aroma of dried grass, a bready orange scone, some caramel. Hop aroma isn't pronounced.		T: Crackery pale malts initially, followed by wave after wave of herbed spiciness and orange/citrus pith. Hops are reigned in well, however; bitterness never really grabs hold. As someone who appreciates a balanced blend, this one's right up my alley. 		M: Creamy feel, soft carbonation, velvety coating. Medium body. Nothing to get all excited about, unless 'smoothness' gets you excited; if so, this is your beer. Slight stickiness and chalkiness in the finish detracts slightly.		D: Solid Pale Ale, well-balanced and easy to drink. All those activities listed above? Yeah, take this along while doing them. To the list, I'll add: 'Go Play Right Field for the Office Softball Team'; 'Go on a Double-Decker Bus Ride for a Friend's Birthday'; and 'Go Sit on the Couch after Hanging Christmas Lights'. Caldera, take it everywhere you go...

review/text: The can seemed to contribute to an exceptionally creamy head atop a cloudy golden yellow body. The color was a bright lemon yellow closer to the light source. The head retained itself well, dropping with rocky craters. 		The nose was crisp and refreshing. The bold caramel and citrus aromas hit the nose the hardest, balanced very well. Lemon and orange oils make up the citrus profile. The malt backbone is substantial, clean, pale malts for the most part.		The flavor had more hop intensity than I was expecting, yet the website claims 55 IBU's, so maybe I should have expected it. Strong soapy pine highlights crept close to IPAdom. The finish is long, dry, and bitter. 		The body had good viscosity, very creamy feel with a chalky dry finish. Not a bad effort here, this one is not for one who's hop shy. Caldera does make an IPA, I am now more excited (than 15 minutes ago) to try it.

review/text: 355ml can poured into a young's pint pot.		A. Bright gold with a towering white head, bright gold that is until the sediment took over proceedings, the beer then took on a 'marbled' appearance with the yeast suspended half way up/half way down the glass. As it diminished, the head sounded like rice crispies 'popping'.		S. Lemony and zesty, good hop character.		T. A lovely hop bite accompanies the slightly fruity malt, splinters of pineapple.		M.Medium, mouth coating.		D. Another good offering from Caldera. These canned craft beers are a joy to have. Maybe one day ALL beer will be canned rather than bottled.

review/text: Love the IPA from these guys so I had to give this one a go...		Pours a light golden yellow... Sorta hazy... Pretty decent head...		Balanced aromas of malt and hops with the malts being a little more dominant... 		Sweet buttery malts with a slight hop finish at the end... The hops seem a bit muted here... Could have been a bit more balanced... 		A decent brew I guess... Not one that I will reach for again especially with the IPA available..

review/text: Bright, clear golden color with a massive head that filled half the glass thanks to my overly-agressive pour. Head settles at a moderate pace and leaves lot's of sticky lacing. Already a sign of hop oils. I'm getting excited.	Citric hops in the aroma. Pink grapefruit.	Same citric hops that are in the aroma, are in the flavor, but the flavor is much more balanced than the nose forshadows. Sweet pale malts with a nice hop kick. Not overly complex but I don't expect APAs to be too complex. This is exactly what I look for in a Pale Ale.	Very crisp and refreshing and easy to drink. I could drink a few of these on a hot summer day. And the fact that it comes in a can just make it that much more portable for hikes and such.

review/text: Thanks to tjensen3618 for putting on the LIF which brought me this can.		Clear straw yellow body. Careful pour produces a towering four finger white head. The head works its way back at a moderate pace leaving some scattered lacing. 		The aroma is rather balanced. The pale malt is a bit more assertive than I would like to see in an APA. Pale malt is sweet and bready in the nose. Citrus fruit aroma provide the counterpoint to the malt.		Warm toasted bready flavors are the first to hit the palate. The hop flavor follows soon after but fails to assert itself enough to overcome the malt. Light grapefruit with a bit of a pithy bite. A brighter hop profile would do wonders hear.		Light to medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Smooth texture. The finish is moderately dry, a bit of malt flavor does linger a bit.		Yes, this beer is very drinkable but it also falls short of my expectations for the style. The aroma and flavor are lacking for an APA, the attributes remind me much more of an english style. This is a beer I could see drinking a few during a barbecue or other social events. Decent session beer.

review/text: 12oz can poured into an imperial pint glass. A new to me canned beer, love it...		Pours a clear golden amber with three fingers of frothy white head which leaves tons of lacing behind...		Strong citrus hop aroma at first, grapefruit. Sweet malts come forward after a few whiffs, slightly bready...		Decently hoppy for an APA, a lot of them just fall short in this category unfortunately. Overall sweet, juicy citrus hops are prevalent. Sweet, honey-like malt flavors come forward after the initial citrus hop taste fades, with some earthy dry hops quickly washing the sweetness away...		Medium bodied with good carbonation, smooth, a lingering bitter drying finish...		Pretty good, I love APA's out of a can...would like to try this again knowing for certain that it is fresh. Why can't breweries date their beers???!!! Frustrating!

review/text: Grabbed a single 12oz can at The Andersons in Toledo, Ohio.		Appearance- Pours a brilliant deep straw color with faded hints of pale orange. Big, rocky eggshell white head rises and clings to the glass with each sip leaving an absolutely beautiful lacing behind.		Aroma- Bright hop aromas of grapefruit, pithy orange peel, and slightly pungent pine. Healthy burnt sugar and sweet malty undertones with a whisper of mineral-like yeastiness. 		Flavor- Nice balance from start through the middle and into the finish with soft caramel/burnt sugar maltiness and a hearty pungent citrusy vein of hop goodness. Bitterness and hop pungency intensifies into finish and lingers well beyond the exhale with a kiss of cracker-like light malt. Very refreshing, crisp, and edgy pale ale! 		Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied, low-moderate residual sugars, moderate CO2. Nice balance, but definitely some sticky hoppiness to this brew. Refreshing with an edgy, pungent, minerally dryness in finish. 		Overall- This is ridiculously drinkable and just about everything you would want in a pale ale! Big hops, but nice dose of flavor, aroma, and bitterness in there. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to keep drinkability high. This would make an excellent lawnmower beer, but still has enough complexity/flavor to be a great pair with food- I'm thinking pulled pork and slaw, or anything spicy. I'll definitely grab more of this tasty nugget in a can!

review/text: 12oz can, unknown date. 		Pours semi-hazy golden/orange/amber with a two finger fluffy white head that leaves some lacing and holds a fair cap. 		Aroma is fruity and citrusy, oranges, melons, pear, green apple, with with an equal amount of sweet caramel and biscuity malts. Some yeasty mustiness. Good overall strength. 		Flavor features some citrus, earthy, floral, and grassy hops, not as fruity as the nose, some crystal malt with mild sweetness, moderate bitterness, finishes quite dry. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and slick with medium carbonation. 		Very good APA.

review/text: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.

review/text: A golden orange and slightly fizzy brew with a slight fluffy off-white head that constricts slowly instead of outright fading away. A few minuscule dots of lace line the glass. A note of citrus hops is noticed on the nose at first, then a slight caramel sweetness follows up. Melon rind, a squirt of lemon on the tongue, some graininess in the background, and a drop of honey makes for a happy palate. Light to medium bodied with crisp edges. Cohesion is bliss.

Aroma is very citrusy, with orange, pink grapefruit, and pineapple hints. Toasted caramel underneath.		Mouthfeel is clean and evenly balanced, with a medium body and carbonation.		Taste has a prevailing citrusy and earthy hop bitterness that is delicately balanced by a honeyed caramel maltiness. Finishes clean and even with a lasting citrusy hop aftertaste.		Very nice! Tasty and highly drinkable.

review/text: Can I stumbled across somewhere in Ohio where this beer surfaced after being "imported" on the grey market. I was assured by the proprietor that this was fresh.		Looks wonderful in my pint glass. Serious 2 finger head that sticks around and around. When it does subside, a beautiful lace is left behind. The beer is orange with some gold highlights. Agitation brings it back at full force. A great start.		Smell is average, unfortunately. Some citrus hops and some pale malt. But not as pronounced a boquet as I would ask for. What's there is orange, sweet marmelade on biscuits, and caramel.		Taste is also just not cutting it. Looking at my experience rating APA's, I've had several that just pack more flavor and in more creative ways. Great Lakes Burning River and Three Floyds Alpha King blow this away. However this is decent. My biggest issue is that the citrus-backed bitterness and the sweet kiss of honey and bread crust from the malt just fall short of anything more than the average. 		Mouthfeel is above average thanks to the adequate, smooth carbonation and medium body. Finish is wonderful with just a touch of lingering bitterness. Very drinkable as well, I'd like to try it from the source sometime to see what's it's like when maximum freshness is assured. When it surfaces in Ohio, it just lacks the depth and punch I like in my APA's.

review/text: Poured into a 7oz. snifter.		Appearance: Poured out quite nicely: produced one finger's worth of fluffy, off-white head, which came to rest atop a crystal clear, golden body. Faint streams of carbonation did their best to keep that head up, but it eventually faded to a sticky crown. Bubblebath-like lacing trailed the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nice.		Smell: Pineapple + cat pee = Simcoe. Those are the two aromas I got right off the bat. Pine bark, wholegrain toast, and lime also pulled through. If I could guess, I'd say the hop bill includes late additions of Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Not bad, but not what I typically prefer in a pale either.		Taste: Whole grains, butter and dough form a lovely malt backbone. Lemon zest accents that backbone, while woody hops create a bold, bitter aftertaste. Not sure how old this can is, but I love the malt-hop balance, which is tilted just a bit toward the malty end of the spectrum.		Mouthfeel: Caldera Pale Ale's active yet soft, rolling carbonation massaged my palate for the entire session. The body is light, crisp, and very refreshing. To top things off, the beer finishes bitter but not too dry, and leaves a flavorful, long-lasting aftertaste. It don't get any better than this. Perfect!		Drinkability: The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of New Belgium's Ranger IPA (in a pale ale form, of course). I didn't expect a whole lot out of this one going in, but I finished it in a flash! Will definitely buy more if I come across it again.

review/text: A solid APA - hops bittering is a bit non-descript, but perhaps the cleanest flavor profile I've come across in this style. Nice carbonation. Lively, refined malt notes with firm, consistent hops bittering throughout. Excellent drinkability and sessionablity.

review/text: Poured into a tumbler at 45 degrees. Medium yellow body with an eggshell white 1 finger width head. Retention is agreeable, and lacing is average.		Smells of pine, caramel, butterscotch, fusel alcohol and bread eminate from the glass. 		Quite a bit of butterscotch up front, which I must admit is a bit of a turnoff for me, I'm alright with caramel, but this was a bit buttery. Finishes up with some caramel, pine needles, grapefruit, and traces of alcohol.		Mouthfeel was about what I expected, and felt pretty solid all the way around.		A pretty good pale ale, but I was left a bit underwhelmed in the end by the malt profile. Just above average for a pale ale.

review/text: Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007.		The more craft beers that come in cans, the more the stigma that surrounds canned beer will fade away--plus, there is no debate about sunlight and bottle color. That dead horse has been beaten way too much.		Thin tiny-bubbled lace forms from a moderate pour, retention is fine and the lace stays around for most of the session. Brilliant golden color shimmers in the light. Flowery citric hop aroma screams Cascade hops, bit of biscuity malt with a mild caramel sweetness in the nose. Light to medium body with just as much smoothness and crispness, both with ample amounts for the semislick mouthfeel. Minty and earthy yet mainly citric-flavored hop draws in a lot of flavor with a solid bitterness. Very clean palate with bread notes, almost grassy graininess in the middle. Hop bitterness digs in deep but does not go too far to throw anything out of balance. Cascade hops are all over the finish with an earthy citric flavor. Ends with a touch of dry maltiness.		A benchmark ale for PNW Pale Ales, if not American Pale Ales altogether, and that benchmark is not of modest stature. It shows great balance without the Cascade smack taking over, clean and very drinkable. The last of the sample was paired with a plain goat cheese and Pink Lady apples--very nice.

review/text: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date		Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head.		Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale.		The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing.		Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. 		While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.

review/text: Appearance - Pours an almost clear, light golden color with about a finger of relatively slow dissipating head that leaves decent lacing on the glass.		Smell - Toasted bready malts up front with a slight hop profile. I mainly get the bready malt aroma from this, not much else.		Taste - As with the nose, I get heavy bready caramel malt flavor, light floral hops, and just a hint of citrus. Reading some of the other reviews perhaps this is an older can? I do not get nearly the amount of hop profile as others are describing here; mainly light floral hops. Also, I do get just a tinge of honey at the end.		Mouthfeel - Medium to light Mouthfeel, decent carbonation.		Drinkability - This is a good "lawnmower" beer in with flavor. Did not present itself to me as anything special, however, it is a easily quaffable beer that would be great on hot summer days.

review/text: Thanks to Flexabull to sending me this one out in the vet BIF. I like canned brews that are good and this one fit the bill. Can poured into a strain pint glass produced a nice amount of white head that settled to a lace. The body was clear golden amber in color 		This brew had plenty of floral hops aromas coming from the glass I could tell this was a west coat brew. The flavor was very hop forward too. I think it was extremely close to an IPA in my book, but I have noticed more and more of the APA's heading in that direction. It was crisp and light in the mouth.		The brew was quite enjoyable to drink and I easily could have drank a six pack at a BBQ

review/text: Golden amber with a big foamy head that just floats on top. Crisp pale malt and floral hop aromas. Flavors of light floral hops with a good malty reflection that combine to make a honey-like finish with a light hop linger. Medium carbonation with a non descript mouthfeel.		It might not look like much but it tastes great although there's also not much to talk about in the mouthfeel. I really liked the honey I tasted in the finish.

review/text: Picked up a can at Abe's Cold Beer for a couple bucks and drank it with a Thai curry (good combo). At first seems like a simple, but tasty pale ale. The malts provide a little toast and caramel, while the hops pull in the usual citrus notes. As it warms and I think about what I'm tasting and smelling, a lot more comes out. There are hints of pineapple in the hops, hard sugar candy in the aroma, and peppery spice compliments the orange rind aftertaste. Check this beer out and make sure you let it warm up.

review/text: Pour - dark golden, not a light-colored pale by any means. Orange with splashes of yellow and a frothy half inch of bubbly white goodness on top.	 	Aroma - citrus-y and cascade-y. Plenty of fresh floral hop aroma combined with a solid amount of sweetness. It has a light piney smell along with that of cake frosting (perhaps?). Hmm...works for me.	 	Taste - damn good. I'd leave it at that but I suppose a person wants to know a little more. A big sip delivers a bitter hoppy bite that is subdued calmly and respectably by a dose of malty medicine. Things are balanced and smooth with just a hint of sharpness in the finish. Love those cascade hops and the fact that this is a close 50/50 when it comes to the malt to hops flavor ratio. Great pale ale from the folks in Shakespeare land.	 	Overall - I really enjoyed this pale ale. This is a very drinkable brew and I mean that in every way possible. Its simple yet flavorful, hoppy but also balanced. Its simply a very good beer. 	 	Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I could get some more of these, actually I wish I could get more of all the Caldera cans as I really enjoyed each of them very much. Cheers!

review/text: Poured this 12 oz. can into a Sam Adams glass. No date. The body was pale gold. The head was modest and bright white leaving only bits of lace.		Smell was a pungent, leafy, skunky hops - yum!. Tea, which was strong but faded. 		Taste was green and grassy with a nice lingering bitter finish. Not hasrsh, but flavorful. Enough biscuity malts to give it some pale ale balance. Very solid and highly drinkable.		Mouthfeel was medium to light in body. Adequate carbonation, finishes pretty smooth. (My 700th review)

review/text: 12oz can received today by the great trader known as russpowell. Thanks Russ!		My first brew from Caldera, there seems to be a kind of obsession with the number 60 on the can that I'm not "getting".		It pours a clear light golden colour, good 2 finger head of foam, looks to have some good lacing.		The smell is big citrus hops and an equally big nose of grain, not so good, and some honey, which is nice. Ok, now the grain surpasses the hops and everything else and I'm saying what? I have mixed feelings on the smell, which, don't get me wrong, isn't bad, it ends up being good. 		The taste is a battle between the hoppy bitterness which is, really, a nice light citrus combined with some pine, and a strong grainy flavour that for me, seems out of place for an APA. Hell yes, I like a good malty presence in the style but I'd rather have some sweet caramel taste to balance the hops than an all out frontal attack of grain and grain is what is distracting me. To no good end. Dang.		On the high end of light bodied, lowish level of carbo. The mouthfeel is just fine.		Drinkability? I've noticed after further sipping that the combination of the hops and grain make for an undesirable, to me, bitterness in the finish so...I'm glad this is only 12oz. I'm not fond of this but I'd like to take a stab at Caldera's other offerings. I never judge a brewery based on a one and only beer I've had from them. ;^)

Bready, biscuity, malty with a hop character in the finish. The breadyness makes this almost "buttery" in texture. 		Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium and creamy. Carbonation is okay. 		Drinkability is rather high...lower ABV, great mouthfeel, good taste.

It has a solid pale malt scent with some bisquity notes and a mild citrus hop aroma. There is a creamy/bready character to it. The taste is good as well. It has a good hop bite up front along with a balance of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite a hoppy APA. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation.

review/text: Poured into 12oz straight glass. Poured a cloudy yellow, almost the color of pineapple juice, with barely a thin cap of white head that had no retention and minimal lacing.		The aroma was mostly malt forward, a pleasant change from Pales that are basically "IPA light", with just enough hops to keep the scent balanced. The flavor was balanced as well, although I thought a little on the bland side. None of the flavors really jumped out at me.		The body was typical for the style but lost some points for being overly sticky. Drinkability was OK, I'll drink it again, but this beer is not on the level of Mirror Pond or Manny's.		Overall, a decent enough brew, but nothing special.

The pale ale appears a clear pale golden yellow color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a thin lace on the glass with each sip. The nose and flavors consist of toasted bread, crackers and biscuits, pine, lemon, sweet malt. Decent body for the style with adequate carbonation. Pretty tasty overall.

review/text: 12oz CAN into a regular kitchen glass during a snowstorm.		A- Bright white golden in color with much clarity. A whirlpool of bubbles erupt a nice bright off white head that just seemed to keep building. This beer is alive. No lacing though, ah well.		S- A west coast forward PA with the hops winning the race. I'm smelling at least one of the 3-c's backed by a bready mix of yeast and malts. Biskits in the morn. There is some grassy notes towards the end though, but this is a pale after all so it's in line.		T- Caldera Pale Ale is a winner, A great balance between hops and malt with a little edge on the former. Just a little touch of a tropical fruit mix leading to a bready finish that's clean as a whistle. Not bitter at all but you can kind of feel the hops for about 1/2 a second.		M- Easy on the mouth, this one is easy in all aspects of the word. A great balance that results in a feel that's not hoppy and not malt forward but somehow manages to meld greatly. Two notches above light with a small bite from the carb.		D- As long as I can find this fairly fresh(no canning date), I will be drinking it. A easy going pale ale that has great flavor and a easy body for multiple rounds.

review/text: A clear bright gold color. I can't really smell much - some weedy skunky hops as it warms up, but not intense - this is an APA - relax. Now I'm picking up baked bread aroma from the malt. Nice - layers.		Nice pleasant hop flavor on the medium bodied, lightly toasty malt spine. The hop flavor's character reminds me of some Lagunitas beers with their blend of herbal, grassy, and tropical fruit flavors. This is moderately hoppy, appropriate for a pale ale.		I guess this could be a recovering hop-head's session beer. It's really pleasant with real west coast hop character but without the intensity of an IPA or beyond.		Good mouth feel - goes across the tongue fairly softly and has a nice drinkability.

review/text: At one point, I wondered if I could ever find 100 CANs, then 150, but now that the CANQuest has breached the 200 mark, I realize that the sky is the limit. People are sending me unsolicited BeerMails for trades for new CANs. Keep 'em coming, folks!		After a seemingly steady diet there for a while of AmeriCAN macro lagers, it is nice to see and smell something decent glug-glug-glugging its way out of the CAN and into my glass. 		I caught two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention that was already beginning to leave a nice lace in its wake, following my pour. Color was a slightly-hazy honey-yellow. Remember, kids, clarity is overrated! Nose was grapefruit-citrusy. Pale Ale, bah! In many of our Central-Southern states, this would have been their IPA. I began to weep at the thought of previous recent CANs like Lone Star and Stack - rubbish in a CAN! Recovering, I took a sip and got a mouthful of full-on Cascade hops! Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! If this was simply their Pale Ale, it struck me as to why I loved their IPA in a CAN so much. I may have found a new favorite brewery for CANs... I allowed myself to luxuriate a little more fully in the second sip. It was very citrusy on the palate and even a little grainy, as though the liquid were saturated by hops. No matter, because on the swallow, it was so dry that I could not help but reach for another sip. More, please, sir.

review/text: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.

review/text: A: An amazingly clear, golden pour from can into glass with a fluffy white head that sits on top.		S: Just as a pale ale should be: a refreshing citrus aroma with a mild pine to let you know that it still means business.		T: Again, a perfect example of a pale ale. A nice clean, refreshing citrus flavor followed by a nice bitter bite on the finish.		M: The beer is light and moderately carbonated, but still has a fairly substantial feel on the tongue.		D: This must be what Bud is talking about. These guys sure know how to make a great session pale and IPA. I'm glad to see these beers become more easy to come by in CA.

review/text: A - Hazy golden orange with a huge off-white head. Three finger head slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves scattered lacing all over the glass.		S - Big citrus fruit aroma, primarily grapefruit with hints of lemon zest. Light sweet backing, a bit of biscuitiness coming through.		T - Very bitter hoppiness up front with lots of grapefruit coming through. Hints of pine as well. Just the faintest sweetness backing up the hoppiness but this is a very hop forward pale ale.		M/D - Medium bodied with a touch of chewiness. Spritzy carbonation. Easy drinking pale ale.

review/text: Great pale ale. Really sticks out among this blahh category.		Very well balanced and refreshing. Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.

review/text: Appearance :	The beer pours an extremely clear yellow leaning on the golden/orange side. The head that appeared looked like clouds forming, the color of the foam was pure white it looked like a nice layer of clouds hovering on top of the liquid.		Aroma:	There is not a whole lot of aroma but can smell a slight hint of citrusy hops.		Mouthfeel:	It has that dry astringent taste that some wines or teas leave behind.		Flavor:	This is something I really enjoy with pale ales or IPAs. Really bitter for a regular Pale Ale which is surprisingly a good thing. As I keep drinking it tastes more and more malty but definitely has the hops bitterness right up front above all else.		Overall Impression:	I nice hoppy bitter Pale Ale. I usually say why drink a regular pale if you can go for the India, but this I would drink again if given the option between other pale ales.

review/text: Can pours a clear gold with a sticky white head that laces the glass. Vibrant, leafy hop aromas are not overpowering but fresh and inviting, and are exceptionally well balanced on the palate by equally bold, complex malts. This is a very nice beer, one that I intend to buy again.

review/text: Poured from 12 oz can into a pint glass.		Appearance: very slightly cloudy golden-straw hue with one finger of nicely foamy head, leaving a good lacing.		Smell: prominent aroma is of nice earthy hops. Pretty nice.		Taste: quite hoppy. Malt is toasty and slightly sweet; hops are mostly earthy, with a little spice and a little floral character. This beer is unbalanced toward the hop side of the scale, but not overly so. All in all a pretty good pale.		Mouthfeel: pretty solid medium body with an appropriate level of carbonation. I like it.		Drinkability: this beer is not overdone; it is a solidly sessionable pale.

review/text: 12oz can poured into a pint glass		Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens.		Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste.		Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.

review/text: Appearance - This is a light and bright orange in color with a modest head that showed great retention.		Smell - This is an even combination of nice grain and fruit-juicy hops. The citrus hops are very intense and at first appear to be overtaking the nose but then the grain proves to be a bit more stubborn. Together they form a fair balance and a beautiful APA bouquet.		Taste - The hops are more forward at the taste but the grain holds its own. It's easy to wax on about the hops because they are big and exceptional, but I'm going to talk about the grain here a bit. They are light for sure but show a sharpness not often found in the style. This IMO allows the hops to stand out without being overbearing.		Mouthfeel - This is bigger than a light lager but not medium-bodied. There's a bitterness here that is somewhat mild but forceful in that it finds its way throughout the mouth from beginning to end.		Drinkability - I was very impressed with this Caldera can. The style usually is not one to stand out but this effort is an exception.

review/text: I picked this up at Outlet Liquors in Rehoboth Beach DE, poured chilled from the 12oz can into a half pint. 		A - A moderately clear pale golden w/ a 2 1/2 finger cap that is cream colored. The head is rocky w/ a fine bead, light haze (hops) w/ light lace that collects like dripping paint streaks		S - More pine scents from hops than anything but full of aroma all the same w/ mild malt accent and hint of floral aroma		M - The feel is medium w/ crisp effect of sufficiently bitterness, medium carbonation w/ mellow toasted notes and a semi-dry finish w/ mild alcohol in the feel		T - The crispness of the flavor in the malt is noted and followed immediately by a pine + citrus hop taste. The bitterness is prominent and subsides gradually into a light toasted note like baked biscuits which is well blended under layers of bitter tasting spicy pepper and pine. The flavor has a mild citrus pinch in the finish w/ more rind taste than flesh of fruit. The bread crumb-like malt taste is trailing w/ dry leafiness and mild alcohol as it finishes		D - A bitter pale mainly to put it lightly, more like a light IPA. A tasty ale no matter which side of the fence it's on, though. I would probably try this again.

review/text: A - A finger of compact fizzy white head... Moderate retention gives way to a full rich lacing which is slightly thicker in the center and slightly lighter around the edges... Loads of moderate paced small carbonation bubbles rise throughout... Light golden color with a slight orange hue... A very modest haze throughout... 		S - Distinctive citrus hops aroma is unavoidable... Also present are faint hints of caramel, saw dust, honey, lemon zest, and sea side fresh air... A wonderful, but slightly subdued aroma... 		T - A metallic tinge to start... This gives way to a fairly assertive piney hoppiness... A quick malt burst of bread and caramel followed by the return of the metallic hoppiness... There was also the slightest hints of rye and wood detected... 		M - Sturdy... Clean and crisp... Goes down very easy... A modest chalky texture... 		D - Quite sessionable... Another solid offering from Caldera, a very underrated brewery all the way around... I will gladly keep exploring there brews and will quickly jump at the chance to revisit this terrific brew...

review/text: Thanks to Kegatron for a can of this.		A-Bright golden hued copper with a thin off-white head that left spotty lace.		S-Honey sweet malt with a kick of floral, grassy and lightly citrus hops. Nice base of backing biscuit in the background.		T-Aggressive hop bite in the forefront with a sharp floral bite that transforms into biting citrus rind. Honey bread malts balance out the hops.		M-Medium-light sharp and crisp with a nice lingering spicy hop bite.		D-Damn solid, not quite Sly Fox Phoenix Pale Ale but a nice alternative. A nicely hopped, honey sweet session pale. Another quality brew from a can--let the revolution live on!

review/text: 12 oz. can, these guys finally showed up in the Southland, another Oregon brewer to try out,		A: Pours a dark yellow, with a finger of white head, solid lace.		S: Earthy hops, one-dimensional. Cascades.		T: Upfront cedar-box and tobacco in the hops, quite bitter and earthy initially. Malt character is very light. Notes of pine oil late.		M: A bit too light-bodied, soft carbonation.		D: My uncle used to live in Ashland, so I've been wanting to try the Caldera beers for sometimes. The Pale was OK, the hop flavours weren't really to my liking, time to move on.

review/text: Comes out of the tap an opaque deep sable with a minimal head, but the latter may be an artifact of te pour. Smoky aroma has tones of molasses and high-quality coffee. Absolutely delicious flavor has roast coffee, chocolate and molasses components and is just slightly sweet - and superb! Smooth, fizzy texture is extremely pleasing. If you visit the Pacific Northwest, look for this one!

Pours a dark chestnut brown -- bordering on black -- with a frothy one-finger head with good retention and lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee.		Opens mighty tasty with big notes of licorice, malted milk balls and chocolate. Suggestions of chocolate milk and espresso enter the equation. A hint of oatmeal surfaces. Creamy mouthfeel throughout. Exquisite balance between roasted and caramel malts. Moderately dry finish.		Very drinkable and quite delicious. Spot-on for the style.

review/text: I had this on tap at the Horse Brass Pub in Portland.		A= This ale poured a deep brown/black with a 1" slightly creamy tan head. The head lasted a good long while and left some sticky residue down my glass. 		S= Slight coffee roastiness mixed with treacle-like sweetness combine to make a rich aroma.		T= Extremely tasty porter here. Started off as a battle between slightly bitter roasted malts and the sweetness of the caramel malts. Some earthiness and dark fruit esters creep in to add complexity midway. Finish was medium dry - sort of an extension of the same taste battle. 		MF= Medium bodied with just the right "medium" carbonation for the style. Refreshing without being sharp on the tongue.		D= Very sessionable despite the ABV. I really enjoyed this porter and would consider it in among the top 10 examples I have ever had of this style.

The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.

review/text: Appearance: deep black with a 3"+ tan colored head that lasts. Thick lacing coats the glass.		Smell: nice roasted malts and coffee are easy to pick up.		Taste: this was like eating a loaf of pumpernickel bread. Roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolates, molasses, and a hint of nuttiness rounded it out. 		Mouthfeel: smooth from start to finish. Medium bodied like a porter should be, not some stout-like meal. Bread and roasted tones linger briefly on tongue.		Drinkability: very easy drinking as this is flavorful without the heavy body. Definitely a nice brew.

review/text: Pilot Rock Porter was served on tap at the Night Light Lounge in Southeast Portland. This is a great neighborhood bar, with a fine, if not huge selection of beer, and deserves some spillover beer geek traffic once the Clinton Street Theater's brewpub opens down the street. Anyway, the porter is lighter than your typical porter black, more of a transparent ginger brown. The head is small but the lacing is determined. The aroma is mild rainy day, and the flavor profile contains deep caramel, light smokiness, cured meat, cola, and a tart herbal quality that masks the malt sweetness. It is not an exceptional beer but it satisfies and provides a lighter counterpoint to Caldera's rich coffee/Cauldron stouts.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.		A: Pours a clear garnet color with some hints of cherry red coming through. It has a creamy one finger khaki white head that reduces to a thin film across the top. The beer appears pretty still, no carbonation is seen.		S: Sweet dark fruits are the backbone which include plums and dates. Phenolic smells come through along with belgian yeast.		T: The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma with lots of dark fruits, phenolic aspects, and the belgian yeast.		M: The feel is a little disappointing as it is on the thin side and has a somewhat watery feel. It is very still with no carbonation detected.		O: This beer was just slightly above average for me. The aroma and taste weren't bad, but could use some more depth. The feel was a letdown and could use some work. I picked this one up because of the artwork, but probably won't revisit it very often.

Spices with some roasted malt and nutty flavors up front followed by a light Belgian candy sweetness. The finish has a light smoky bitterness and alcohol burn.		M: medium-light body with medium carbonation, this beers burn and bitterness keep it from being crisp.		O: not a bad beer, though I have to say that I bought it mostly because of its name.

I start picking some candi orange notes as this warms, a touch of juicy fruit gum on the edges, along with apple skins. Finishes dry with some orange rind bitterness showing up, some cocoa powder as well		MF: Medium bodied, fairly firm carbonation, a bit too dry for my liking		A decent shot at the style, just didn't pull a the way together for me, still very drinkable		Was hoping for some like an acholic version of Terry's Orange Chocolate (if you know what I'm talking about)		Having read other reviews, yeah what is up with that label?

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Piraat tulip. 1/2 finger of lazy tan bubbles formed on top of the dark copper/brown body. The head vanished rather qucikly, but laced the walls of the glass nicely.		This smells a lot like a classic quad...lots of dark fruits, plums and malt.		Just as the nose indicates, the dark fruits are the major flavor here. The blood oranges can be detected slightly, but not as strongly as other beers that contain the same citrus. 		Medium bodied...a little sticky with moderate carbonation.		Not a bad offering...a little heavy after the first glass. Well balanced flavors and one of the coolest (and disturbing) labels of all time!

review/text: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.		Appearance: Pours a clear very dark redish amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring.		Smell: Malty with some fruity notes along with mild chocolate and spice.		Taste: More fruit here than in the smell. Malty and quite sweet, I'm picking up just a bit of the orange. The finish is malty and bitter.		Mouthfeel: Medium body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish.		Overall: Not as much citrus and I would have expected. I would have liked more fruit to go along with everything else. I would probably pass on this one in the future.

review/text: A: pours clear dark brown with a hint of ruby. one finger of white head, very fine buttles that are slow to subside, no lacing. 		S: barley malt, orange zest, pumpkin spices? i'd almost want to guess summit hops without the onionyness. 		T: slight hop bitterness at first, then smoked and barley malts, vanilla, bread, campfire, caramel, honey, and lingering hops. a touch of minerallyness, perhaps crystal hops?		M: slightly astringent from the carbonation that quickly subsided to smooth medium bodied barley malt. marginally tart on the tongue afterwards. 		O: bottle says orange bitters and zest - i only taste zest, and not that much, which may have been better replicated w/ appropriate hops. a fun beer overall, i'd drink it again, but not at the large-bottle price. if it sold itself as a brown ale, i'd like it more. belgian yeasts arent as present, and the intended spicing is overwhelmed by roasted barley. i liked this a lot, despite being oddly unfitting to any style.

review/text: poured from a 22oz bottle to a couple of taster glasses with a buddy. Dark amber/copper in color, dusty off white head with fast fading carbonation. A little haziness. 		Smells of hard candy, tart citrus, spices and little like a fruity cough medicine. Not in a bad way though. I enjoy the aroma after a few minutes of temp increases. The tart nose softened a bit.		Tastes a little sweet, I get the hard candy sugars again, dark fruits, faint orange zest. The flavors are combining with a slight medicinal taste. Some spices, maybe nutmeg, cinnamon? The orange flavor comes across a bit "artificial", maybe the bitters?		A very different brew, surprised my palate a bit. Stands on its own in flavor and not like anything I wouldve expected. I enjoyed it more at cask temp after it smoothed out. Deecent mouthfeel. Not in hurry to obtain more, but not really bad if you want to try something new.

review/text: Had to give this a try, based on the name and the label. A bit disturbing, if you dwell on it too much.		Ruby brown with 1-finger pale cream head. Light lace and just a touch of head left at the bottom of the glass. Great color, though.		Nose is caramel and brown sugar with a touch of Belgian yeast. Getting the orange zest about half-way through the glass.		Orange much more evident in the taste, with more blood orange than zest. Lots of caramel malt and sweet molasses here. A bit of roasted toffee, too. Touch of bitter orange in the finish. Nice twist. 		Feel is pretty solid. Very creamy with just a touch of carbonation. 		Overall well worth trying. Just got to get past that label.

review/text: Had to get this one for the name, Grabbed a bottle when I came across it at the store. The pour was a murky orange brown color with a fluffy tan colored head on it. The smell of Belgian yeast was prominent, along with some citrusy aromas and earth too. The taste of the beer had some sweet notes up front with the fruits and brown sugars that might be in there. The finish was a little on the dry and spicy side. The mouthfeel I thought was just a little thin. Overall the beer was worth the try for sure. I would probably buy this one again in the fututre.

review/text: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.

review/text: This beer is an awesome color, a very dark brown that only lets small amounts of light through around the edges. Head is thin and fleeting, the small amount that sticks around is like cream poured in a latte. Smell is a light belgian roastiness, something like a sweetness mixed with coffee and a slight amount of bread. It's very faint, hard to pull out any specific aromas.		Taste is great, a roasty brown ale with a belgian-friendly slant. The yeast lightens up the beer considerably, very thin up front with most of the body in the middle and finish. The sweetness hits first, followed by the roasty flavors and orange bitters in the back end. Nothing in the beer is really overpowering, but it's not weak, just tame. On the whole, it seems like there's a tendency to go crazy in the BSDA category, this is a reserved offering that's great for a nice relaxing evening, definitely in opposition to what the label may suggest.

review/text: I got this one from Lazerlobe a while back in a BIF. Thanks again! Poured into a tulip. The beer pours a dark mahogany with slight red hughs and a small off white head. 		Interesting aroma here. I get dark chocolaty malts with a hint of orange zest. Don't really know where the chocolate is coming from but this smells pretty good. Choclate taste without much noticability of orange flavors as the label of the beer would indicate. Strong malt flavors here. 		The feel is pretty good, soft carbonation and a full body help this a lot. Good beer, kind of a sipper and it's not so much what I thought it would be as the label indicates but an interesting effort.

review/text: Pecan shell dark brown that becomes burnt orange and dark cherry red with backlighting. Appropriate color for a BSDA. The good looking lid of golden khaki is not Belgianesque... nor was it expected to be. Thick streamers of sudsy lace means no real negatives.		I'm not getting much in the way of Belgian yeast esters in the nose, which makes me think the brewers used dark candi sugar, but not Belgian yeast, and called it a day. Not getting the blood orange zest either, just some dark malts.		Vas Deferens Ale is the first Caldera brew that I haven't enjoyed immensely. While it isn't bad beer, it's a sorry excuse for a BSDA no matter how you slice it. The flavor profile does not fit the style, not least because there still isn't much contribution from the yeast... which is what should be driving this car.		Specifics include toasted pumpernickel, medium-dark fruit, black tea, black pepper and a modicum of citrus zest. That last one isn't immediately recognizable as orange, blood or otherwise. Warming brings a bit more boldness and definition, which is enough to tilt the score in an upward direction. Good sweet-bitter balance and skilled alcohol masking help too.		Since nothing else about this brew is Belgianesque, it would unfair to ask the mouthfeel to be. It has neither the medium-full creaminess, the expansiveness, nor the hang-on that it needs to earn the 4.0.		Unless you have a passing familiarity with human anatomy and physiology, it's probably best that you don't know what the singing devil on the rather disturbing label is being showered with. Hey Caldera, in the interests of gender equality, how about giving us Fallopian Tube Flanders Red Ale next?

review/text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #42 (Jul 2010): 		Crazy name, disturbing label. WTF!! LOL ... we're OK now. It's a dark and heady brew. Brown sugar, medicinal phenols, bubble gum and ripe fruit make for a Belgian-like aroma. It is crisp and smooth with a bitty mouth- feel. Suggestions of chocolate, oranges, toasted bread and rum come to mind. With modest hops, the alcohol is very prevalent; lots of ripe tropical fruit in tow. Bitter orange wins over the blood orange zest. This beer is not half bad, and certainly worth a try if you can get past the label.

review/text: Beer poured from a bottle into a beer mug. The beer pours an extremely dark brown with a foamy, light 2" head. The beer has smells of alcohol, citrus, and heavy malts, but all well blended together. The beer has a robust burst of flavors, again well blended like the smell. There are flavors of malt, sweetness, citrus/orange, and a little bit of molasses undertone. It's impressive that these bold flavors all blend so well, and the beer still manages to be smooth in mouth. There is an alcohol tinge to the flavor, and it is rather pleasant along with the rest of the beer. There is a very smooth finish, as well, and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink despite all the strong flavors and the decent ABV. Pretty decent brew, and it's unfortunate that this is a rare release. I think this could be a decent flagship beer for the brewery. If it weren't for the sticker price, I would bring home a lot of this one.

review/text: Appears dark brown with a medium light brown head.		It smells of oranges, chocolate, nutty malts and it strangely smells a bit like cherries.		It tastes strongly of oranges. The orange flavor almost has a fresh taste to it. The malt taste to the beer is a bit nutty and chocolate like. There is a noticeable amount of Belgian yeast flavor. I get a tangy almost chalky flavor from the yeast. The yeast also seems to add some fruity characteristic to the beer. This most orange tasting beer I have ever had. They must have added a lot of orange zest to the beer.		The carbonation is medium low in this beer. It has a smooth carbonation to it.		The drinkability is pretty good for the how high it is in alcohol. The beer has a smooth flavor so it is quite easy to drink. 		Overall, a distinctive creative ale that has some minor flaws but overall is a nice tasting beer. This is an interesting take on Belgian strong ale. Worth trying.

review/text: A: Pours a translucent, deep ruby with brown highlights, capped by a finger and a half of frothy head. Retention is moderate as it settles down to a thin layer of foam and holds there.		S: Dark fruits - prunes and figs - along with some oranges and wheaty base. A strange salty, vinegary aroma not unlike green olives lurks in the background. Doesn't kill the beer, but it's a big strange.		T: Lots of dark malts, some chocolate and coffee, and a big dose of dark fruits. The oranges come through a bit but not overwhelmingly. Some light tartness near the backend. Long, sweet finish.		M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation.		D: Bold flavors, but somewhat unbalanced...not a particularly interesting beer.

review/text: Roommates GF brought home a bottle to try... love the name, label.. etc.... let's see what we've got...		- Clear, and rather dark brown ale of sorts.. glows a touch red as well... big off-white head... leaves a bit of a ring and a subtle layer on top...		- I get some bitter hops, tangy Belgian-like yeast.. wheat or a wit quality... and green olives. I usually get a green olive smell when something is wrong.... little spice, zest, earthy...		- Esters.. fig, prune, fruit... yogurt.. spice, and some green olive... a very interesting almost iced-cream-like approach to a beer... a cream flavor exists... zesty tangy hop.... very interesting. I am also getting peanuts... lots of essence of peanut... like peanut butter.		- Medium bodied, creamy.. dry, and chewy. 		- Certainly an interesting brew. Just a touch off for me though... could do without the green olive smell.. but I would love to know what they put in this... certainly pushing the envelope with this one.

review/text: 22 oz bomber to pint glass		Pours a rich reddish-brown that, although isn't cloudy or murky, is dark enough to let little light through. It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing.		The nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it.		The flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced.		Given the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8%		This beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here. There's a template in there to work from. But if I was Caldera I would go back to the drawing board on this one.

review/text: Chilled bottle into a glass. A generous gift from ramnuts. Thanks, Frank! 		Shared with alfrantzell and chswimmer. 		A: Pours a clear maroon body with a light tan head. The bubbles fill the tulip but quickly collapse into nothing. 		S: Not much aroma at all. Some nuts and orange, perhaps. 		T: This beer initially tasted like sushi. Ted narrowed it down to the seaweed wrap used in rolls, but I am convinced I picked up the soy / cardboard signs of oxidation, as well. As it warmed, those flavors receded a bit, producing flavors of orange, nuts, coffee, and some kind of spice. Somewhat disjointed. 		M: Oddly thin, with a watery flavor. 		D: Not enjoyable...

review/text: Bomber poured into a large goblet, Vas Deferens is dark garnet brown with a small eggshell head that leaves light, scattered lace. 		Smell is sweet and very rich. The blood oranges really come out, as does some peppery spice. 		Taste is okay, pretty similar. A Belgian inspired kitchen sink strong ale. Very phenolic, but as it warms the blood oranges come out stronger and temper those somewhat. Still, this beer is sharp and disjointed overall. 		Mouthfeel is on the thicker, sugary style, sticky, not particularly digestable. Dry finish. 		Drinkability isn't too hot, all the ingredients lack synergy and fatigued my palate in a hurry. There's a reason this is a one-off, it really should have only been a tasting room pilot batch.

review/text: 22oz bottle.		Pours mahogany with an amber hue and a half inch head of tan. A whisp of foam on the surface and a few dots of lacing thoughout the glass.		Aromatics lead off with raisins, chocolate-laced malt, cloves, bubblegum, and plums. Hints of citrus, smoke, espresso, and cocoa follow through.		Medium bodied with a slick, chewy mouthfeel. Extremely light carbonation for the style. Tacky and a bit syrupy.		Plump malt, caramel, brown sugar, and raisins start the palate. Dark rum with orange oils follows through along with hints of roast, peppercorns, and booze.		Finishes with rum-soaked raisins, sweet malt, and a citric undertone.		Tasty enough but there's an odd bitterness that lingers. The spicing adds a nice touch but the beer drinks more like a "Gran Cru".

review/text: The pour, into a Westmalle chalice, is a perfectly clear but dark, ruby/amber with a short off-white head that falls quickly to just a partial cover. There is light carbonation visible but no lacing.	The smell is faint cherries.	The taste is some cherry and some roasty malt that finishes with a hint of alcohol.	Mouthfeel is nearly up to medium with moderate carbonation and slightly sweet.	Drinkability: For me, it wasn't particularly anything I'd want to try again, especially at the price (about $10 in SE PA). There are many $10 22ozers that are superior, even in this style. This is not a bad beer, but more of an indifferent beer. When the beer name and graphics are more interesting than the beer, the beer is either great & the graphics are phenomenal or the graphics are great and the beer is, sort of, forgettable.

review/text: I believe that this is not going to be a rotating beer but that this is a limited one time brew. Just my belief subject to confirmation but this is part of the Caldera Kettle Series, a "Limited Small Batch Seasonal Release."		Pours a dark copper red with a yellow/white head. 		Sharp smokey spice sweet cherry cola nose. 	 	Mouthfeel is thin/medium thin with a light "elegant" carbonation. Light creamy character. 		Flavors follow nose; all smokey, spice sweet cherry cola and lots of cocoa flavors. Very well balanced in that there is a hint of bitter sweet chocolate that goes to a bitter sweet chocolate finish. 		Flavors do have definite undertones of the orange bitters and blood orange zest.		Nothing stands out but this beer if really welcoming and immensely drinkable; you just want to keep drinking more. A much more complex brew with loads of flavors profiles that sneak up on you. Very nice effort.

review/text: An interesting beer with an equally interesting name. Vas Deferens pours a lovely deep reddish tinged brown with a nice, slightly tan head that has nice retention. The aroma is sweet and a bit boozy with plenty of dark sugar and fruit notes, chocolate and a bit of spice. The taste is very similar. Fruity, caramel, chocolate and slightly spicy with a bit of herbal hops. It also has a slight sour note to it and some definite orange like character. It is an interesting beer, but really not that compelling. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice finish, and it is of average drinkability for style. It is an interesting beer, but really not that compelling. Still, a well made brew with a name that makes me giggle. That has to be worth something.

review/text: Somewhat disturbing but hilarious label - the devil ripping a vasa deferentia in two, thus completing a vasectomy, hence the name "Vas Deferens". The label states, "A belgiian-style ale with a unique twist incorporating a little snip of this and a little snip of that."		Poured this from a 220z bottle into a Brouwerij 't Ij tulip.		A: Deep copper, reddish hue (i'm assuming this is from the blood oranges) with a 1" head that dissipates slowly and leaves small amounts of lacing. Really nice looking.		S: Sweet cherry, citrus and chocolate with some spicy herbals in there as well.		T: The orange is there with a heavy chocolate flavor and creamy stout characteristics that are very prevalent (roasty and malty). Not as strong of a flavor as the look and ABV would suggest.		M: Medium bodied but on the lighter side for this style of beer. Mellow carbonation with a spicy bight.		D: Looks like it would be an intense beer, but it's actually smooth and easy to drink. Good dessert beer after a nice dinner.		My only gripe is the price - $10.49 a bottle! Come on guys, seems like you could drop the price on this a bit. I understand it's limited release, but there are far better beers in the $7. range (which would be a much more accurate price for your product).

review/text: 22 oz. bottle, an ale brewed with blood orange zest and orange bitters,		A: Pours a dark burnt orange to brown with a medium white head, some lace.		S: Definite orange peel, some dark candi sugar, but relatively light for a Belgian style.		T: The orange is definitely there. More of a straight up caramel malt flavour than most Belgians, only a hint of yeast esters with some kumquat marmalade. Not hugely complex, but a good flavour. The orange complements the malt base well.		M: Well-attenuated for this style for sure, off-dry, medium-bodied, smooth.		D: An interesting beer, I wanted the blood orange to come to the forefront a little more as it's a great flavour. I wanted the beer to come out and grab me a bit as a big Belgian. Good beer, not worth a $10 bomber price tag for sure.

review/text: Strong hop bittering married to a coffee-enhanced roastiness with a surprising malt turnaround towards the finish. This stout is black as it gets with modest brown head and lace. The mouthfeel is notably well contoured. The flavor and aroma of this 2004 winter seasonal approach being outright carbonized. You can almost literally taste the blackness of this doubly roasted brew. 			Dark and hearty though at times cloying.

review/text: 22oz bomber poured to a snifter.		A- Pours like a thick motor oil. Ebony tint with a tiny ring of mahogany soap on the brim, otherwise virtually no head. Zero lacing.		S- Dark licorice aromas with a little tobacco, smokey char, and a slight bit of alcohol on the tail. Strong undertones of molasses and sticky dark fruit round out the nose.		T- A bursting blend of licorice, dark baker's chocolate, burnt sugar (almost creme brulee crust...) with a dominate raw tobacco character. Followed shortly by an intricate smokey char that is kindly humble and not overpowering as it goes down. Balances well with the moderate roasted coffee tones and woody cedar characters that hit mid-palette. It got more aggressive in flavor as it warmed, but for the most part I found the taste to be balanced and smooth.		MF- Smooth, velvety and soft. Lower on the carbonation with a slightly soapy feeling in the throat and a lighter dry coffee astringency on the tongue.		Overall a nicely crafted, smooth stout. The char and tobacco characters really highlighted the complexity of this beer for me. Pretty good.

review/text: Received in trade with ArchEnemyBrew.		Pours a deep black, with a quickly fading mahogany head. 		The aroma is full of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, hits of dark fruit and just a bit of alcohol. 		The flavors delivered are lockstep with the nose. Full of roasted malts, almost a slight smokiness. Bitter dark chocolate, with out being off-putting. All rounded out with the slight sweetness of dark fruits, raisin, plum, fig.		The mouth is a little thinner that every other part of this brew would lead you to believe. It's not watery, but just slightly lacking. I prefer a RIS to coat a bit.		This is really good RIS. I didn't have any idea of what to expect when I opened this one up. I was pleasantly surprised with what this brew delivered. Other than being slightly thin, the look, aroma and flavors are all what you want in a solid RIS!

review/text: 22oz bottle split into two large snifters		Pours black with no head. Tiny quantities of bubbles drifting along in a lonely fashion. Smells like licorice and liquor.		Taste is very pleasing. Licorice and coffee roasty malts mix together with some bitter burnt toast and nice malty sweetness for a very nice flavor.		Mouthfeel is thick, a little gritty, slightly dry. Overall, forgiven for apparent flatness. It's good.

Pours ebony with less than a pinky of mocha colored head.Near zero head retention & lacing		S: Chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, & a touch of Bourbon once warm		T: Follows the nose, plus some herbal & woody hop notes, charred grain & dryness up front. More charred grain & Baker's chocolate as this warms. Finishes with a nice chocolate sweetness, herbal hops, a bit vanilla & more charred grain		MF: Chewy, oily, subtle carbonation		A nice Imp Stout, didn't quite come together for perfection, but a solid offering

review/text: A: Mud black with a thick & frothy tan leather colored head. Retention is pretty good. It dwindles after a few minutes and leaves a beautiful bright tan ring of foam around the edges with some loose bubbles.		S: Smell is dark fruit, brown sugar, light roast, mild chocolate, and some light neutral hop bittering.		T: Taste follows the aroma. Roast and bittering up front, some dark fruit to wrap it all together with a bit of brown sugar malt sweetness. Medium body, clean finish.		O: Good overall, RIS. Well crafted. Awesome appearance, good all around taste. Would purchase again.

review/text: 22 oz. bomber,		A: Pours black with a medium frothy tan head, good retention, solid lace.		S: Dark chocolate with some creaminess and roast.		T: Dark chocolate flavours dominate with a hint of coffee. Some sweet malt, but stays balanced with a solid hit of hops on the back end. Never overly burnt which is as it should be in an RIS.		M: Full-bodied and very smooth, soft easy carbonation. Elegant.		O: This is classic American made RIS style beer to a T. It's weird, it seems the regular RIS is going away, everything has to be barrel aged or have some adjunct added to it. That's all well and good. But sometimes you just want a big straight up stout and this delivers. $10 for the bomber is pricey, but it's a great beer, definitely the best I've had from Caldera.

review/text: Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice balance of aromas and flavors. This one took me by surprise.

review/text: Imperial stout = dark beer, no different here, its black. Foam about 3/4" deep, tan, light brown colored, hits the bricks right quick sucka. 		Coffee absent in the aroma, otherwise, chocolate malt, light boozy in a good way, warming, hides abv relatively well, no coffee to it still on the mouthfeel. Sticky, bitter, low carbonation. About 1/100th of the smoke they put in rauch ur bock. Plenty chewy. Maybe some licorice.		Pretty good stuff. What a bummer mine followed a Mogli. Tough act to follow, but would not heitate to recommend this beer, just like 99% of the rest of Caldera's stuff.

review/text: Pours pitch black with 1/2" of foamy, brown head. Great retention. Smells of roasted malts, a little coffee, and a little chocolate. Taste is similar to the nose in some respects but far more complex. Deep roasted malts and hint of coffee up front followed by a rich chocolatiness in the finish; just a hint of alcohol esters in there as well. A few more sips reveals a little toffee and some dark fruits; alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms but doesn't detract from the flavor or drinkability. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and surprisingly, dangerously drinkable.

review/text: 8.8% abv.		A: Black with a tan head, ring of retention leaves a little lace.		S: Light licorice, black strap molasses, black berry and hints of biscuit & nuts.		T: Pleasant licorice flavour that's not overdone, allowing some other flavours to come through: black strap molasses, woody/oak, cocoa, light pepper, caramalized raisins, hints of coffee and rum. There's some underlying cola and sasparilla flavour as well. Alcohol is subtle. 		M: Moderate to full body has a light residual sweetness with a slightly drying finish.		D/O: It drinks well, and I wouldn't have guessed it was that strong. Well crafted and an all around good brew. The flavours really compliment one-another... the more I drink it, the more I dig it... which says a lot for a big brew!

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.		A - Opaque black. Nothing getting thru, not even on the edges. Dark biege head, good lacing.		S - Roasted malt. A slight smokiness. A little bit of dark chocolate and a little licorice.		T - Bitter chocolate upfront turns to slightly smokey. Leaves a bit of licorice flavor for the end. Not an overpowering licorice flavor, just a hint to make you want more.		M - Medium carbonation produces a not quite smooth feel. Is almost smooth a description? It works either way. Leaves a slight tingle afterwards that works with the licorice aftertaste.		D - Definitely a sipper. Has a thicker mouthfeel that doesn't allow gulping. With the 8.8%ABV, really tastes almost no alcohol.		Great beer. Period.

review/text: Poured into my Founders tulip...		I love everything from these guys and I've read good things about this brew so I'm excited to get to try it...		Huge pungent wallop of dark strong coffee, cocoa nibs, hints of licorice and perhaps a little citric hop as well... Holy smokes...this smells terrific...I'm a bit taken shocked that this is so dark and rich smelling... World class...		Rich deep smooth smokiness mingles with dark bitter chocolate and licorice... The smoky aspects of this set this one apart from others of the style and have me hooked... There's also a big hop presence to this that has me thinking chocolate covered orange or something of that nature.. One thing that I'm really digging is the lack of sheer alcohol present here both in the ABV and the flavor... It's nice to be able to drink the whole bomber and not be blurry at the end... 		This is a world class RIS in my opinion... I could expound with adjectives and adverbs and all the fluff but I'll say its one of the most enjoyable drinking experiences I've had... Not over the top in any way... Delicious and expertly crafted...

review/text: Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.

review/text: A bottle split with oglmcdgl.		Old Growth in the Duvel tulip appears black in color with a firm inch of tan/khaki colored foam that is dense and leaves some spots, great retention.		Smell is ridiculous in the malt category, roasted malt on top of char, some faint dark fruits and some aroma hops. Licorice and anise make up the rest of the smell.		Not so over the top, a very well balanced stout with a mix of roast on top of a bed of dark fruit, chocolate chips, anise and of course licorice. Faint vanilla bean and just good beer here.		Feel is semi sticky full and not hot. It's not the biggest stout out there at almost 9% and I like that, to many 13 percenters that go overboard. Carb is there and not so intruding. Chewy.		This is a kick ass stout. I wanted to see what Caldera could do on their dark offerings as their light ones are top notch and this did not dissapoint.

review/text: A bottle split with onix1agr and poured into duvel tulips. 		A- a firm pour yields almost three fingers of coffee and cream colored head holds for a good bit then settles slowly leaving behind a big swath of chunky sticky lace and a big seam foam ring on top with a big island of suds. Down right black body with just the faintest of brown glows at the edges when held to bright light. 		S- big bold dark roasted malts and a deep molasses sweetness. There some anise and coffee going on that reminds me of new orleans chicory coffee. 		T- yup that a big ole stout. Opens up with a powerful punch of super dark roasted malts that give you a lot of dark bakers chocolate, coffee, blackstrap molasses and dark breads. The roast and sweet are well balanced and a solid earthy hopping blend smoothly in with the rest. Finish is long and roasty but not heavy or overbearing in any way. 		M- full bodied with a bit of chew to it but not sticky or cloying and the carb while staring out light builds just enough to clear the palate and get you going back for more quickly. Touches of heat but its a welcomed heat. 		O- this is a great ris and one that is cruzing well under the radar. Better then a lot of those hyped up beasties and super easy to enjoy. I'd like to get a few of these and lay them down for a bit.

review/text: Pours dark brown, with amber edges; light tan head that quickly falls to leave decent lacing. Smell is faint chocolate and stale coffee, smokiness. Taste is better, slight sweet chocolate, slight coffee, and minimal smoky oak, almost salty at times. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium high, overall drinkability is good for a light stout. Not something I'd seek out again, certainly wouldn't refuse it if offered.

review/text: Delicious full bodied stout with all the trimmings. Leather, wood, tobacco, sugary fruit.		The nice thing about Old Growth is that you can savor the "mature" end of the taste spectrum without having to be knocked out by a 12%+ abv. 		Caldera's move into the richer end of the spectrum is exciting, looking forward to their future beers !		This beer is a great seasonal, not trying to dethrone abyss, but a great addition to the fall/winter lineup.

review/text: 22 oz of 2010, poured the whole thing into a massive snifter. Pours dark, deep and inky black. Small 1/4" of light beige head, infinitely replenished by a steady stream of healthy carbonation. 		The aroma is a complex blend of coffee, toasted wood, dark cocoa, burnt sugars and something like raisins and rum. Exactly how a beer called "Old Growth" should smell. 		Bold. This is a big bold beer and yet is incredibly balanced. Flavor is of chocolate, licorice, burnt marshmallows, coffee and Dr. Pepper (I mean that in the best way possible). None of these are subtle but they all compliment each other without any one stealing the show. Appropriately bitter, solid booze with a syrupy finish. 		This was a great beer and totally unexpected. Big and balanced, a great nightcap or cigar beer (blasphemy!). Enjoyable now or ready to cellar. Highly recommended.

review/text: Vintage 2010.		A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of.		S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy.		T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good.		M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. 		D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9/bomber, I would be all about this one.

review/text: Served in a pint glass		This beer pours a blackness with a beige foam head. The smell while not greatly profound does carry notes of blackened malts and bitter coffee. There is a touch of licorice in the nose as well. The taste mostly reminds of a bad cup of coffee. There is a distinct coffee flavor but mostly it's backed up by a burnt char flavor that lasts into the aftertaste. There is a nice medium sticky mouthfeel to the beer as well. It's drinkable, but only as it warms to room temperature. The only bitterness that I really can't get past is a burnt bitterness and it's pretty palatable in this beer and is really the only reason I was not too fond of it.

review/text: Served in a glass mug.		Thanks to VDubb86 for sharing this bottle!		With a name like "Old Growth" it has to be good, right? It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of light-ish tan foam. The nose comprises blackened pretzels, light char, mild coffee, light anise and roasted malts. Things seem a bit too roasted, a bit too char-y for their own good. The taste holds notes of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, light molasses, coffee, licorice and a dash of chocolate syrup. A touch of what could be very light smoke flickers in the distance. The body is a solid, hefty-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, a pretty nice Oregonian stout, though it may be too much for its (or my) own good.

review/text: 22oz bottle into snifter.	2011 vintage.	from notes.		Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly.		The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice.		The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. 		The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation.		This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.

review/text: On draught at Bailey's, the 2009 Old Growth Imperial Stout is black with a tan collar that leaves light, scattered lace.		Smell is big on the caramel, honey, sweeter for a stout, but clearly one nevertheless. The lavender creeps out a bit as it warms, although this was so delicious, I didn't give it much chance to do so! 		Taste is big, loads of complexity of this one, all the adjuncts combine with the chocolate and roast flavors of the malt to remind me of a really fancy truffle. I particularly enjoyed the lingering taste of the pink peppercorns. For so much complexity from the adjuncts, none of them are over done. Smooth, clean,well executed and exceptionally good. 		Mouthfeel is slick, medium-light bodied, surprisingly, but not in a thin way, just not thick and heavy.		Drinkability is good, this is a really nice RIS, super unique. Crazy flavorful, yet smooth and dangerously drinkable. I'm really digging the lavender the most, I can picture myself in Brussels's Grand Plaza eating fancy chocolate, awestruck. Probably not their intention, but a nicely played invocation nevertheless!

review/text: Snagged a 12 oz. snifter of this elusive brew at Bailey's Taproom; this is the 2008 edition.		A: Crude oil blackness topped with a thin nutmeg orange head. Any head fades away to the thinnest circling ring, lace droops in slim bands and scattered speckles. 		S: Malty sweet nose of fudgy chocolate, mild vanilla, candied fruit and a vague woodiness. Intriguing floral aroma, perfumed with lavender.		T: Big chocolate and an astringent coffee roast hit right upfront; sweeter notes of vanilla, even maple syrup, follow. Lots of grain, mild fruit (say, earthy blackberries?), and a fair amount of piney woodiness. LOVE the spiced honey flavor!		M: Lots of grit and grain fill the mouth, stick on the teeth. Imagine a cup of French Press coffee, how it sticks... That's the Old Growth way. Otherwise, a smooth carbonation and velvety mouthfeel. Long-lasting bittersweetness.		D: A hefty mouthful of darkness with each sip. Enjoyable, certainly a beer I'll have again. The guys at the Taproom were saying the 08 is great but that the 07 was incredible; note to Caldera: can this beer. Please.

review/text: 2004 VINTAGE		found this delicious glory at Bailey's Taproom. 		pours an absolute opaque oil black with tannish head. it just looked so enticing with its murkiness and darkness. by the color i knew i was in for a treat		rich rich malty aroma with caramel, roasty notes, chocolate, slight pepper, interesting floral notes, and i think licorice, slight dried figs or raisins, and candied sugars		BOOYA! on the palate. rich rich rich plethora of flavors begin the symphony of beer and endure for minutes. a rich coating of more bittersweet chocolate upfront, followed by semi-dry roasted notes, coffeish notes, hints of hot pepper, faint raisins, mildly floral notes which i couldnt place but are definetly there, and slight candied sugar notes on the finish.		super smooth and balanced with a medium weight, the beer just absolutely coats the mouth with layers of goodness. its hard to get all the nuances at once but man is there a lot to enjoy. balanced all the way through, not too sugary or dry, and the flavors just meld seamlessly together with every sip tasting different than the last, and no trace of the alcohol		amazing stuff, truly, one of the more memorable stouts I've had in a long time, with layers of flavor mixing together to create a textured, balanced, nuanced, and super smooth stout. i wish i had had the patience to drink it room temp. cause I'm sure even more goodness could be discovered, but alas, i enjoyed every second of the beer and if you see it on tap, order it

review/text: It's helpful to know something of what you're drinking in advance of drinking it. I knew Old Growth was an imperial stout, but I wasn't aware it was brewed with licorice, honey, chocolate, lavender, and pink pepper corns. So when I drew the snifter to my nose and inhaled its essence, I was caught off guard by its peculiar tapestry of fragrances. I kept wondering if the beer wanted to smell and taste as it did, or if bad luck was conspiring against it. I concluded that Old Growth suffered from no unintended intrusions, but I was still perplexed by its uncommon design.			I found Old Growth on tap at the Fort George Public House in Astoria where it was featured among other notables as part of Stout Month. Fort George was serving it in 12-oz. snifters where its panoply of sharp aromas was ably focused. Chocolate flavor was featured abundantly, yet the fragrance was also enhanced by a spice mix suggesting mint. The taste worked parallel to this and I was convinced I was drinking a chocolate mint elixir - pure girl scout cookie. 			Old Growth's body is oily black with sepia froth. Its complexity makes it an anomaly in a snifter but a year of aging at least tempers this with some smoother contours. I came to enjoy it, but it's clearly not for everyone. 10.3% ABV.

review/text: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing.		Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.

review/text: Red mahagonny. Yellow tinted head, thick full and dense, holds itself with stern authority. Sticky lacing also.		Great hop aroma. Thick citrus fruit with berry components. A bready sweet malt really mends well with the abundance of fruit.		Impeccably balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary necessarily but one of those brews that is just dead on. Bitter finish with fruit driven mid palate and a toffee core, all intertwined with dried berry puree. Nice and thick and drinkable.

review/text: Poured in a pint glass from a tap handle that clearly stated Dry Hop Red, this was an orangish amber with 2 finger white head, which faded to a thick skim leaving lots of lace. 	The aroma was very bright and fresh cascade hops, behind which lay a few fruity esters. 	The taste was really nice, my kinda of hoppy beer. Sure, there was a bitter backbone on the finish, but only as much as necessary to keep it balanced. This was all about the citrus and floral notes of the finishing/dry hops, nicely complimented by lots of stone fruit, particularly apricot. The malt, like the bittering hops, only served to keep the sweetness and check and relatively balanced. This is the hoppy NW brew I'd been waiting for, and I'm glad found it! 	The mouthfeel was medium light bodied with lively carbonation. 	The drinkability of this was very high for me. I had two over dinner, it went well with steamed clams, raw oysters and steelhead. It definitely left me wanting more, and I am surely going to seek this out (as well as their Dry Hop Orange).

review/text: Beer pours a dark clear amber color with a nice sturdy head.		Aromas are of fresh pine like hops. Not overpowering, but what is there is nice.		Flavors are similar to the Ashland Amber, but pumped up a bit. A really crisp tea and malt like character starts out up front. The beer then finishes with a dry bitter hop finish. 		Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is good, and the flavors are full.		Drinkability is quite good. Session worthy, and a bit more interesting than the Ashland Amber. Pretty good stuff.

review/text: Decidedly crimson, clear, with just under a finger of slightly off-white head with lowish retention.		Good citrus-Cascade nose, but not quite as strong as I would have expected.		A straightforward, dryish, slightly caramelly amber ale with a good dose of citrus hop flavor. Nothing too complicated, and entirely pleasing, though I found myself yearning for just a little more malt in the background. I love it when hop juice becomes hop syrup...

review/text: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you!	When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is "hopjuice". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well.	Terrific and recommended if you can get it.

review/text: Wonderful crisp, fresh ale from a truly small and dignified brewery. They don't bottle, so I think it's mainly available on tap at isolated spots in southern OR/northern CA. A glass full of clear garnet-red liquid. Sharp hop nose, floral and minty. Modestly malty body two-steppin' with firm, diverse hop bitterness. Quite nice and drinkable.		Confused with Dry Hop Orange in other reviews. Fact is, Dry Hop Red and Dry Hop Orange are two different brews from Caldera. Red is maltier and deeper in hue, Orange is fruitier and paler, but both brews are similarly fresh and hoppy.

review/text: Tap handle red "Dry Hop Orange" but alas, here we go.		Warm hoppy sack of Mt. Hood on the nose. Citrus and Oranges rise up to the nearly caustic bitterness. Thinish mouthfeel, but damned drinkable.		Amazing blend of malt and hop gives this a shockingly Orange Juice like flavor. I was convinced this was a fruit/vegetable beer, and my notes end with "blows ApriHop out of the water". Hey, it was a long night of beer tasting ... still this was one tasty brew to quaff through the hot Portland summer night.

review/text: At last, the fine Caldera brew Ive been waiting for. I first heard of this beer on the streets of Ashland where word of mouth about a good beer is a recognized sign of an enlightened populace. With high hopes I went to the Siskiyou Pub in pursuit of this craft beer and was rewarded with a fine drinking experience. 			Just as word about this beer reached me before I could drink it, so too, the fine aromatic fragrance of bright floral hops leapt out at me from the glass before I could take a sip. Its not surprising that a dry hopped beer should carry such a resounding hop fragrance. Still, the vitality of the aroma was compelling. And the hops were not limited to a mere fragrance. The bittering element was concise with a touch of spice and a protracted bitter finish comparable to an ESB. 			All this from a beer of lush crimson with a razor thin head.

review/text: Some discrepancy since the tap pull said Dry Hop Orange, but since nothing else shows on the site, I assume its the same thing....		Wonderfully rich copper color with drops of a rich red turning it darker. Nice foam cap clinging tightly with a pleasant yet assertive fresh citrus hop aroma. The taste is of similar richness. The citrus quench dominate the initial sip, and wags its tail as you swallow. A nice crisp malt body in the middle with enough richness to make it a red. Really, a very pleasing beer, perfect for the lupomaniac in your life.

A: This beer has a dark brown reddish look that had a pretty tan looking head. 		S: It smells quite intense. A resin malty scent that carries with it some alcohol.		T: This beer tastes like resiny caramel. It is a little sweet and has a long drawn out flavor. 		M: It dries out your mouth with the lingering dry aftershock. Not a very carbonated beer. Quite a bit of body for even this color.		D: I could have a few of these. Definately an intense strong ale, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for Caldera.

review/text: Sampled a pint at Bailey's Taproom. Pours a light tan with golden highlights, with a small, one-finger, creamy white head that takes a few minutes to retreat to a pretty ring around the top of the glass. Aroma of sweet biscuity malt, a faint whiff of tobacco, and a very mild hit of brown sugar.	 Palate is mild sweet malt up front, with notes of biscuit, light brown sugar, and just a touch of fruitiness. A very slightly chalky bitterness appears briefly before the swallow, with the finish leaving a mild, stone-fruit sweetness lingering for a few moments. Body is just a little thin, but fairly creamy, making this a highly drinkable beer. I'm a fan. Even though it clocks in at a bit higher ABV than most marzens, I could happily drink a couple of these in a sitting. Good stuff.		(Note: Not sure if this is the same as Caldera's Oktoberfestbier or not. Anyone who knows, please clarify.)

review/text: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #42 (Jul 2010): 		YES! More craft brewers need to adjunct their beer. The lacing has staying power, though the haze on the yellow is distracting. This lager packs a yeasty, grassy aroma. Crisp and a bit slick, obvious light body. Fresh- cut grass and nutty yeast coat the palate; hops are fresh with ample bitterness and a good amount of flavor, which brings this beer up a few notches. The maltiness is a bit light, but right where it's supposed to be. Flavor overrides cleanliness. Very drinkable as well.

Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness.		Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel/honey. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this.		Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation.		Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.

T: I was really expecting a lager with a bit of hop to it, judging by the name - "Lawnmower Lager" thinking it might be a little grassy (hoppy), much to my dismay this couldn't be further from the truth. There's a weird overwhelming honey malt flavor that is out of balance and I really don't get a nice lager flavor at all. It really reminds me of that cheap beer - "Oregon Honey Beer". Nothing special at all, and especially at $5.00 a bottle.		M: Light bodied and fizzy as hell. 		D: It's actually quite drinkable and probably it's greatest quality, but at $5.00 a bottle - give me a break.

review/text: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.

review/text: 22 oz. bomber,		A: Pours a pale yellow, soft white head, fairly good retention per the style.		S: Some grainy malt notes, light hops, mild inoffensive nose.		T: Direct pilsner esque barley malt flavour, light hopping. Again, mild but the malt flavour is good.		M: Light-bodied, crisp, very clean, refreshing.		D: A solid pale lager, not as much flavour as I wanted, maybe akin to Full Sail Session is what I was looking for. As an innocuous easy drinking lager it did its job.

review/text: Saw this at the store for a great price (2 bucks for a 22oz bottle) and picked it up.		A- A clear pale straw yellow, very clear and clean. Very little head but then again most beers of this style don't have much head so in comparison to the style it is good. 		S- This has your typical lager yeast smell. There is a bready, earthy, grainy and gritty smell. Very rounded and bold smells in terms of beer of this style.		T- The beer is crisp and refreshing. I'm getting a big grain taste that is like chewing on the top of a barley stalk. More like the smell of when a grain truck dumps its freshly harvested barley load into the grain grate to be weighed and priced, take that smell and put it as a taste and that's what I'm getting. There is a subtle sweet honey taste that is coming though and adds a nice level of flavor. There is actually a nice complexity going on with this beer, especially when you are comparing it to other beers of the style. 		M- Good mouthfeel, nice carbination and a very light body.		D- Easy to drink, the name of the beer fits very well. I would drink this after working out in the yard no prob. This is clean but not BMC clean. It's more like clean but in a dirty glass type clean. 		Lagers are not my favorite styles of beer. But one thing I've found is that the flavors are more subtle then other styles. Many craft lagers get a bad wrap because of BMC lagers and how many people are so against them here on BA. I rated this beer based on its style, and for its style it is very well done and tasty. I would definitely buy this one again.

review/text: Poured a very pale yellow. No head whatsoever. Some bready aroma, but very light. Very faint lemony flavor. Extremely light malt flavors that finished with a distinct light beer aftertaste. 	This beer shoud've been labeled as a light beer. Shame on me for buying a lager with an ABV less than 4. Almost any mass produced light beer is better than this one. I even drank it after mowing my lawn. Should've had a tall glass of water.

review/text: 22 oz bomber. Slight aroma of bread, light whiffs of cheese for some reason. Ugly looking beer..insipid pee colour..least the small white head hangs around. Taste papery, bread, some lemongrass. Really very little to it Macro-lager palate to it..average. Overall pretty bad stuff here.' Get a 40 of MHL or PBR save you money.

review/text: Pours clear gold with one finger of fluffy white head. Minor lacing. Aroma is slightly corny, some bread from the yeast. Taste is malty and just a hint of hop bitterness. Clean and full bodied for the style. Moderate carbonation. Clean, sweet, and some mild bitterness in the finish. Served a bit warmer than the style calls for. Still prefer Full Sail Session beer for mowing lawns but if Caldera were to can this beer I would drink some on a hot day by the pool or mowing the yard. I like the fact that it is 3.9% abv. Good beer for such a low alcohol content. Really a "light lager". And in that category it is a winner. I paid $3.09 for a bomber which is too expensive for lawnmower beer. Let's see if they can this brew. I would buy it over the macros if it was about $5.99 a sixer.

review/text: Let me start by sharing what's on the side of the bottle: "For all you people who are afraid of beer you can't see through, this one is for you. This beer is yellow, fizzy, and clearly meant for washing dirt out of your mouth after mowing the lawn." I'm not even sure it's good for that. It's definitely yellow and fizzy, with no head to speak of, and zero lacing. It almost smells like a loaf of bread, and nearly tastes the same. It's very earthy and grainy with nary a hop to be found. Man, I love me some Caldera, but I would rather drink a Bud Light than this on a hot summer day. Sorry guys, but this beer gets an F.

review/text: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever.		S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well.		T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.

review/text: A- is cloudy and light glassy goldeness 	S- smell of light winter pine needles and small delicate floral hints	T- the taste is light and easy to drink, very winter like in the beginning. Reminds me of being in a forest and then at the end your hit with small hints of flower flavor.	M- easy to the tounge and flows with 2 waves of flavor. Both are easy and satisfying.	O- this is a very unique beer and I would recommend it to any one for a very different drinking experience. It easy and I would drink this beer in the winter or spring. Its very light and still has a pretty high alcohol%.

review/text: Split the bomber with my girlfriend who picked it out because of the roses. 		Pours a clear gold/orange with a small white head.		Smells floral as expected with some malty sweetness too. Not really picking up heavy roses on the nose.		Tastes weirdly floral, but not good floral like a heavily cascade hopped beer. Hardly any hops at all, just a weird rose flavor. Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard.		Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. 		My first drain pour in quite a while. After a few sips these became way too overpowering and going through 22 oz wasn't happening.

review/text: Interesting beer...not too sure how I feel about this. Looks good enough...cloudy orange with a decent white head. Malty, very floral smell. Creamy, light caramel scent. Light hops.		Weird, floraly hop taste. Sour-ish after taste. Weird, bready character. Definitely can taste the rose, but its all muddled. Nothing really stands out.		Slightly flat, not horrible. I think this would be better as a pint or a six pack, not a bomber.

review/text: Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass. 		A- Pours orange golden color with about a finger head that died instantly. Not much to look at, but would say this is about what I would expect an "Imperial Golden" to look like.		S- Oh boy, this isn't good. As my buddy whom this bomber was shared with put it, "One time I puked up a bunch of Cheetos, this smells like that..."- While I agree this was very displeasing, I was able to pick out a few herbal notes. This reminded me of a crappy floral tea. I got the rose petal here and there, but it wasn't in a nice delicate aroma; it was more in your face and mixed with DMS.		T/M- Not very good. I tried to give this a chance but I couldn't find what they were going for on this. It is all malt with no hops presented in any way, shape, or form. I wonder if they 100% replaced the hops with rose petals? Thats what it somewhat tastes like; though the rose petals still aren't prominent or pleasing to the palate. There just wasn't any saving grace to this beer; it's a shame.		O- I hate to say it, but this was a drainpour by both of us that shared the bomber. We tried, I think I did more than he; but in the end neither could stand to go on. I understand the whole experimental aspect of this, and I appreciate it, but I do feel like Caldera missed the mark- whatever that mark may have been. I do love me some other Caldera brews, but this one got away...

review/text: It's a beautiful beer to look at. Pours crystal clear with a glowing golden tone. Head pours healthy and then fades to a thing foam. Really great looking.		Nose really doesn't jump out at me. Pale malt tones with a tea-like herbal tone to it. Really nothing noticeable, and that includes the rose.		It tastes similar to the nose. There is a floral tone to it. Not hoppy floral but like an herbal tea floral. It's difficult to describe. Luckily, I happened to have a bottle of rose water around so I took a sniff of it and I just couldn't make the connection. The beer as a blonde ale is really very solid. The pale malts work wonderfully with the carbo to create an extremely refreshing beer. This would have been nice to have during those 95+ dog days of summer .		Overall, it is a solid beer. I have to say though, I had a difficult time pulling the "rose" flavors from the beer. I'm happy I was able to try this limited release and I look forward to more of what Caldera is going to offer.

review/text: 22 picked up on the drive home from work tonight at Brewforia... Paid about $5.50... Poured into my Old Guardian goblet.		The label calls this an "Imperial Blonde" brewed with "real rose petals" and "Hungarian rose water".		Pours with a short lasting white head... very clear golden brew... lacing is minimal but present.		Pale malts in the nose add a nice sweetness that helps the floral qualities.. Interesting.. I can pick out the rose petals, but I'm not getting rose water.		Flavor is actually just a well made (yet big boned) blonde.... pretty malty from front to back with a lingering finish that makes me think of the backyard roses.. but I am honestly having a hard time pulling it out.. the rose water really only shines about 5-10 seconds after the sip goes down the gullet.		Ehhh.. Body is a nice solid medium.. carbonation is a tad light.. 		Glad I got the chance to try this one... I'm interested in seeing what future reviews hold as I think my palate is not refined enough to really grab what the brewers were shooting for.		All 3.5's

Bitter pink grapefruit with a good hit of caramel malt, A little acrid on the tongue but turns into a nice bitter hoppy finish.		Mouthfeel. Medium-strong carbonation. A little thin and a little warm alcohol.		Drinkability. A good drinker. Seems a bit acidic, but a good long hoppy finish keeps me gulping this one down.

review/text: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. 		The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. 		The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. 		Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.

review/text: Appearance (4.5): Slightly cloudy dark orange with a finger and a half of cream colored head. Gold around the edges. Great lacing after the head reduces to a thick film.		Smell (4): Bready malt and citrus and pine hops. Some darker crystal malts probably account for the darker color and more pronounced rounded, caramel scent. The hops really open up once it warms. 		Taste (3.5): Bitter upfront with grapefruit and not yet ripe oranges. A bit thin in the middle and not much there. Nice flavors on the finish with a lot of bitterness and some resinous piney flavors that linger with the residual sweetness. Very nicely balanced for as bitter as it is. 		Mouthfeel (3.5): Medium bodied and medium to low carbonation. A nice resinous mouthfeel that lingers. 		Drinkability (3.5): I could drink a couple of these but probably all night. Pretty bitter for a regular IPA, but that's not hugely detracting for me.

review/text: Pour: Light copper color with hints of red. Two and a half fingers of off-white head that sticks around for awhile and laces the glass nicely. 		Smell: Strong grapefruit aroma up front. Underlying tones of pine, caramel, and slightly fruity. 		Taste: Citrus and piney hops make their presence known up front, followed by a rich caramel malty character that's slightly biscuity. Some hints of tropical fruit also come through, and finishes with a huge tart grapefruit bitterness. Beautifully balanced flavor. 		Mouthfeel: Medium body and oily. Coats the mouth with hop oils. Pretty high carbonation. Dry finish. 		Drinkability: Very smooth drinking IPA. Refreshing and delicious.		Final Notes: A delicious IPA that comes in a can. What more could you ask for? Has enough flavor for pairing against a spicy meal, but refreshing enough for tailgating, fishing/camping trips, days at the country club, and the like. A good all-around beer.

I get clementine and tangerine, apricot, and a little peach.		Flavor - solid bitterness with a crisp hop flavor. I get a good earthy flavor with a nice caramel note in the backround. Good malt backbone with biscuit and cracker dry notes. 		Overall- good everyday drinker IPA. Lots of hop goodness with a solid malt flavor to back it up.

review/text: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber/golden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing.		Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good.		Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink.		Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich.		Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.

review/text: Gotta love an IPA in a can! Poured into a standard pint glass.		A - Massive pillowy head of froth. Transparent deep amber coloration. Excellent retention and lacing.		S - A blast of grapefruit hits the nose. Big hoppy, citrusy aroma. Very nice.		T - Big pine hops come in first, followed by a malty sweetness and rounded out with a sharp bitter bite. Aftertaste is a bit musky, which caused a hit here.		M - Oily medium body with a nice mellow carbonation level.		D - Great, hoppy, yet balanced IPA. Hopheads: Don't let the word balance scare you off here, it is quite enough to get you your fix. Certainly got mine. Can't wait to have another.

review/text: Thanks to Augustgarage for this trade. 		Poured into my dogfish head snifter glass from can. Huge head on this can- almost overflows the 20 oz glass. Head stays for about 3 minutes, and then heavy lacing surrounds the glass. Smell- pine, grapefruit, bread, some lemon and pineapple citrus flavors are present. Taste- I got more pine and heavy hop scent on the nose than I do on the first taste, but it is backed by a nice and mellow malt background. This is not a hop monster, but is very mellow and pleasant. Mouthfeel: syrupy, luscious, nice carbonation. Drinkability: this IPA is very drinkable- very mellow, and overall impressive.

review/text: Caldera IPA pours a slightly hazy golden-amber with half-inch thick, foamy head that is not going anywhere. It has the most serious lacing I've witnessed and my pint glass is coated up to the top. Smell is a grassy and citrus burst, lemons. The taste is very smooth up front with a bite at the end. It has that grapefruit sourness; a nice blend of hops and subtle malts. Slight carbonation and a very easy mouthfeel for this IPA, not heavy at all. This brew should be a top contender in the IPA market if it is not already and it is one of my favorites ever since it was recommended to me. Shout outs to Whole Foods Plymouth Meeting.

Tastes like a great malty background with delectable hoppy bitter flavors dancing on your tongue. No shortage of pine or grapefruit either. Very balanced and flavorful. 		Easy to drink, with a good blend of ingredients producing a rich, smooth beer creation. Definitely a likable brew.

review/text: From notes:		Pours a dark golden copper/amber color with dark ruby red edges hen held to a light source and a massive frothy three finger off-white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a thick lasting cap that leaves sporadic chunks of soapy lacing left behind.		Sweet citrus hop aroma with hints of pineapple, range peel, mango along with subtle earthy pine, subtle light fruit and alcohol.		On the lighter end of medium bodied with a nice balance of sweet citrus, earthy hops and malt backbone. Not overly bitter with hints of grapefruit and pineapple as well as some pine needle and biscuit/graham cracker malt. Slightly dry finish. Decent but nothing out of the ordinary.

review/text: Stradling the fence of an American Amber Ale and an IPA, this beer definately has a sweet side.		Pouring a firm amber color and with brilliant clarity, the beer carries an impressive foamy off-white head, retains well, and laces even better. A quentessential IPA look, but even a mild haze would have been alright.		Caramel richness and piney, grassy, citrusy scents swirl for a somewhat succulent but pungent and sharp hop scents adorn the rim for a balanced and inviting aroma.		Flavors of sun kissed barley malt, deep caramels (almost toffee) and bread crust give a much richer malt contribution to flavor than I'm used to in an IPA. But the hop allow for a zesty flavor of grapefruit, orange zest, fresh cut grass, and spruce that are signature IPA flavors. With no off flavors, esters and phenols to a minimum the beer is well brewed- but the malty rich recipe gives me reason to ponder.		Sweetness in taste result in a creamier and richer body. Creaminess early lingers well into the mid palate and finish before the hops and alcohol force a terse dryness very very late.		A very good beer but the caramel sweetness makes the beer attempt balance where IPA's should be the showcase for hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness. Maltiness also interferes with the body and hinders the crisp and dry attributes needed for greatness in the style.

review/text: Acquired from TheManiacalOne so a big THANK YOU goes out to him!	Poured in to a pint glass.		A: This beer pours a hazy, nice copper color with a two finger of khaki, foamy, rocky head that has fantastic retention. Big sticky sheets of lacing stick to the glass.		S: Nose is subtle but juicy hop citrus notes with a hearty malt backbone with some pineapple notes. 		T: Taste is a big burst of citrusy hops at the forefront. Grapefruit bitterness abound. Mingled with a slight fruity, pineapple and hop presence. The grapefruit really lays throughout the beer, even when a nice hearty caramel malt begins to come in. Finish has a subtle more grassy note hop with a slight lemon peel taste. 		M: Medium body, medium carbonation, nice slick and oily, but kind of dries in the finish. 		D: Goes down dangerously easy, very tasty, nice kick, not too filling, great representation of style. I could sit with this for an evening.

review/text: Reviewed on 1/3/2010. Can. Pours a clear deep orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of piney, grassy hops, some citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor of caramel malt and light citrus upfront with a bitter hops finish. Decent IPA, rather on the bitter side.

review/text: Pours a great copper color with large offwhite head that dies slow and leaves an immense ring down glass. Smell is strong; piney hops w/ citric notes and touch of spice and a sturdy malt base of caramel and some roasted malt as well. Smooth medium body, borderline creamy, with a great citric hop bite and minor sharp carbonation for a cutting beer. Balanced with minor sweet caramel and some roasted/toasted/dry malt feel so you get that pleasure of both citric notes (w/ a touch of pepper or coriander taste) and some sticky sweetness. A real dry, hearty finish lets you know you are drinking a well-balanced and made IPA and while not the greatest beer ever it is rock solid for an IPA w/ that wet, grassy, almost veg like feeling IPAs from the northwest have. A must try for anyone.

review/text: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.

review/text: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!

review/text: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.

review/text: 12oz can -&gt; american pint	no date		Pours a clouded orange with a one inch head that deposits sheets of dusty lace. The head settles to a scattered cloudy sky. 		Nose: Crackery caramel, herbal hops, citrus tones		Full bodied and slick thick. Huge malt profile sweetens with rich deep caramel, toast, and biscuit. Generous hopping give citrus rinds and herbal grasses followed by a brutal drying biting bitterness. The malts and hops battle all the way throughout the lingering finish. Nicely balanced and full flavored.		Seems more like a DIPA to me, hard to believe that the thick malt backbone only came out at 6.1ABV. Quality IPA in a can, gotta love it!

review/text: The can oozed with creamy foam before I poured it. needledd to say the head was soft and creamy. It sat atop the cloudy caramel/orange body for a good amount of time before sinking. It left an excellent wall of lace, topping it all off.		The nose had a good complex hop aroma, just a tad short on intensity. Hints of pineapple, fresh tomato vines, fresh grass, and a dash of astringency and metallic twang make up the one-sided hop aroma.		The flavor is excellent. It takes what the nose started and cranks it up a notch. Passion fruit sweetness meets a bold herbal grassy profile, and the two work together great. Malt knows its roll.... the shy pale toasty backbone. The finish is bone dry with grassy bitterness. 		This one is pretty dry right from the get-go. The carbonation is perfect and keeps it feeling on the light and crisp side. My mouth needs the constant reinforcement of another drink. Great IPA, out of a can!

review/text: poured into an imperial pint glass from a 12 oz can.		A - Pours a strong slightly hazy copper color with some nice orange hints. There is a nice soapy and sticky head on this one that is nice and white and is about 1 inch tall.		S - Delicious grassy hop notes up front. Some cannabis and some nice citrus notes are perceived. There is some nice biscuit malt in the nose as well but mostly it is a delicious grassy and grapefruit hop nose. 		T & M - starts off with some nice bready malt that is then quickly followed by some nice citric and grassy/spicy hop notes. Wow. This is delicious and it comes form a can. Im disappointed I hadn't had this before since it is readily available in St. Louis. It has some nice grapefruit hop hints mixed in with the bready malt. It also has some nice tangerine notes that are citric and sweet at the same time. The body is nice and light with some crispness and a great clean and dry bitter finish.		D - It is very drinkable and yummy with great flavor and good ABV.

Buttery, slightly musty, some fruit - perhaps melon and some orange 		T. Malty, hoppy. A faint touch of scotch in the maltiness.		M. Medium bodied, oily.		D. Another thumbs up to my third canned beer from this brewery but considering that I 'go' for higher ABV beers I would have to rank this as my least favourite of the three Caldera beers I have had but still would not refuse another one.

review/text: Acquired from Tiklmelmo courtesy of the Hometown BIF, so a big "Thank You" goes out to him. Poured from a 12oz can into a US tumbler pint glass.		A: The beer is a light golden brown color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.		S: The aroma contains floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.		T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of citrus and caramel that are quickly followed by strong but not over-powering and very complementary hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.		M: Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean and dry.		D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid IPA that is worth drinking for a long time.

F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer.		D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.

review/text: Thanks to zoso1967 for supplying this tasty brew!		Appearance: Poured from a 12oz can into a large wine glass. This beer ranges in color from golden at the bottom of the glass, to ruby/amber at the top. There's a nice pillowy, khaki one-finger head that recedes at a snail's pace. Great lacing clings to the edges of the glass. Some moderate carbonation is visible in the glass.		Smell: Citrus and pine hop aroma is offset by some sweeter fruit scents and nice caramel malt presence. I'm also getting a touch of bready influence.		Taste: The hops are pretty unrelenting in this one. The malt holds its own though, and breaks through the bitterness a bit at the end. There is actually a touch of sugary sweetness just as the bitterness wears off. The influence is brief and barely finds its way through the hops, but it is a nice counterpoint to the bitter onslaught.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and extremely well balanced. The hops are strong enough to state their case, but subdued enough to let the other flavors have their turn.		Drinkability: A very solid, session-beer contender. I love the can too!

review/text: Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.

review/text: Picked up a 6'r of these at Olive Tree Market here in Ocean Beach for $10.00 - kinda steep, but i'm a sucker for canned beer. I drank them all out of the can so I can't really go into any detail on the beer's appearance, so i just averaged it with the rest of the critique.		A: I'm sure it was good.		S: Sweet and grassy with a bit of malt, but the hops really dominate which is nice.		T: Nice grassy kinda piney hop bight right off the bat with some grapefruit flavor in there too, then mellows a bit which allows the maltiness to come through at the end.		M: Medium bodied but on the lighter side of medium, mellow carbonation but not under-carbonated by any means, someone used sticky to describe the mouthfeel and that's a real good way to describe it.		D: All I can say is that I think this has to be one of the most drinkable IPA's out there. They seem to just go down like nothing- the can doesn't hurt this attribute by any means.

review/text: My thirst is getting to me, so why not an IPA to quench it? On to the beer:		It's all good in looks; dense head, iron orange color in my glass, good retention. The nose is the expected NW IPA dose of lychee, grapefruit, and pine sap. As suggested the nose, this IPA goes towards the "dirty hop" side. Big smack of grapefruit, pine, lingering hop bitterness on the palate, and a hint of orange. The aftertaste of sap lingers softly. The beer has a smooth body with carbonation that doesn't seem like it's there. In all respects, a respectable IPA.

review/text: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. 		Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. 		Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens/green pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. 		Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. 		Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.

review/text: Appears a dark orange color with a large amount of white foam. 		It smells slightly of caramel, citrus and grassy hops. The smell is very well balanced you can smell both malts and hops.		It tastes initially of semisweet malts the malty taste quickly goes away. A profound and flavorful hop bitterness soon follows. There is a nice citrus flavor and also a nice fruity sweetness. Overall a very solid IPA.		The carbonation is moderate low.		This is quite drinkable; I could drink a few of these in a row easy.		An excellent IPA that is hoppy yet is balanced perfectly with semisweet malt.

Tangerine and mango come to mind. Undertones of melting caramel.		Creamy medium body is nicely carbonated. Hop resins are felt on the tongue.		Taste has a dominant pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Solid caramel malt backbone supports the aggressive hops. Some of the tropical citrusy notes of the aroma emerge as it warms. Finishes dry and bitter.		Topnotch! Nicely balanced and very tasty.

review/text: Poured from can to my New Belgium globe. Thanks to Vince for this one.		Appearance - Deep amber orange, completely translucent, not sediment or haze at all. Pours with a very frothy slightly off white 2 finger head that dissipates to about 1 finger and leaves a nice lacing all the way around the glass.		Smell - The smell has some great pine and citrus qualities from the hops. A very rustic and earthy scent can be found. There are hints of grapefruit and a bit of orange rind. Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness.		Taste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness.		Mouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated.		Drinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans. The 6 pack may be an issue but I'd attempt it. 		Great IPA, in a can no less.

review/text: 12oz can, no date/batch code. Just arrived in town, so I'm assuming it is quite fresh. 		Pours lightly hazy orange amber with a good two finger foamy white head that leaves some foamy rings of lacing and holds a light foamy cap. 		Aroma features a good deal of citrus, mostly orange/tangerine alongside some papaya, mango, melon, grapefruit, also a lot of pine, a little floral and grassy, a little sweet bready malt. Good strength. 		Flavor is able to retain some of the citrus fruitiness of the nose, but not all, more resinous hops on the tongue, pine, floral, and a fair bit of sweet bready malt, kinda surprised by the level of sweetness here for an IPA but does help keep it balanced. Fair bitterness on the finish but the sweetness sticks around as well. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky, medium carbonation. 		Very glad to finally try this and it is an excellent well-balanced IPA. The nose is by far my favorite aspect...very nice. While this isn't a straight up hop bomb like a Smuttynose IPA, this one is very well balanced and quite drinkable. Can't wait to try their Pale!

review/text: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all.		S - very strong citrus smells. 		T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish.		D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.

review/text: Beer in Can &#8800; Meh		After year's of corporate programming by Bud, Miller, and Coors, I have come to associate beer in cans as being "meh." Even when I see craft brews in cans I can't help but think "meh beer." But as I sit here sipping a Caldera IPA I am having a cognitive dissonance moment. This beer comes in a can AND it tastes GOOD. Whoa.		Mind = Blown. To review ...		Poured from a 12oz can into a Firestone Walker shaker pint glass.		A: Pours a deep honey color with a good two finger head that sticks around quite awhile before dissipating into a thin layer on top.		S: Smells of citrusy hop goodness.		T: My tongue is braced for hops but wait, what is that? Is that malt? Yes, yes it is! There's a nice malt backbone running through this thing that finished with a good does of citrusy hops. Nicely balanced.		M: A good medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. Bitter goodness lingers on the palate.		D: In one word, very. The balance between the malt and hops is just right.		Overall, I give Caldera IPA a noms and a hat tip for being in a can. :)

review/text: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing.	Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA.	One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit "chewier". 	Very solid IPA.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a chalice. Color is amber/copper. Pours with a beautifully billowing off-white head with great lacing and a 1/3 to 1/2 inch retaining head. Carbonation is present throughout the brew with very tiny bubbles.		Nose is of citrus, citrus rind and balancing malts with a touch of sweet grapefruit.		Taste is immediate bittering with the follow through of the grapefruit rind from the smell. Flavor is clean, simple and crisp and does not try to overpower.		Mouthfeel is right for the style and sessionability is high. Low ABV, easy drinking, can format and simplicity lead this beer to the ranks of a great session IPA good for a BBQ, camping, after mowing the grass or... well... anything.

review/text: Poured into a snifter on 1/30/10		Courtesy of jamdugan		Medium amber color with tangerine highlights. 1/2 inch head thins pretty quickly to a large patch of bubbles. Swirling brings back a decent layer, though ultimately retention is thin. Good amount of lacing.		Floral aromas around the edges are interwoven with hints of pine. Citrus is worked in too, with notes of grapefruit pith, lemon zest & maybe a spot of orange or tangerine. Not a whole lot of predominant malts, just a little sugar cookie sweetness.		The hop profile is very clean. Quite tasty without exhibiting lots of bitterness. The nose seems to be a good indicator, as there's a tendency toward floral & mild pine notes upfront; moderately dense citrus notes are more notable in the middle. Tangerine, lemon & grapefruit fill it out nicely. Faintest of toasty malt in the back; honestly, it's negligible. Maybe a hint of caramel.		Medium-light body gets a little heavier as it warms. Rather low carbonation, but it works for this beer, allowing for expressive flavors. Mild bitterness lingers on the finish.		Very enjoyable from start to finish. Nothing to complain about with this beer. I would drink it regularly if I had access to it.

review/text: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing.		S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs.		T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. 		The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!

review/text: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.

review/text: A - Pours a nice clear copper hue with 1 finger off white bubbly head. Good carbonation coming up.		S - All citrus and pine hops initially, mostly pine. After the initial aroma, the malt base comes through more. Mostly caramel malts.		T - Pine and citrus tastes follow the aroma. Caramel malt flavor is very prominent. First few sips are mostly bitter, but as I keep tasting it, the malt is coming through more and more. Very rich malt flavor with the pine and citrus notes balancing it perfectly. Flavor is much more complex than I was anticipating.		M - Medium bodied, very good carbonation. Not as oily as most IPAs. Finish is bitter and citrus.		D - Great drinkability. Very well rounded and a very smooth malt base to make this one extremely easy to drink.

review/text: Poured from a can into a pint glass		A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. 		S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it.		T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity.		M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA.		D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.

review/text: 12oz can poured into a pint glass...		Pours a crisp dark copper color with nice clarity, two fingers of light tan, foamy, head forms and sticks around for a while, leaving a bit of lacing behind...		A thick, sticky pine aroma hits you at first but it is supported by a healthy dose of caramel malt. A twist of citrus is apparent as well...very nice smelling beer...		Taste follows the nose for the most part. A thick, sappy, pine taste hits first...there is some nice bitter grapefruit skin in the middle and then the beer finishes very full and bitter. The malts are there but do not do much to cut into the hops aggressiveness...		Medium to full bodied. Alcohol is there after a few sips. Thick and sticky, extremely bitter and lingering...		Pretty good one...could use a little more balance though, a bit too bitter, not tasty bitter, just bitter bitter...

review/text: Poured into a San Jose Sharks tumbler at around 45 degrees fahrenheit. A nice looking amber/gold hue to the body with some little rising bubbles. An impressive looking two finger width pillowy off-white head has great retention and lacing. The clarity is excellent. I can't imagine improving the look of this beer.		Smells like a nice piney/citrus combination of hops with a rather strong malt backbone of caramel and butterscotch. I smell some juniper bushes in this one too. A little bit of earthiness and some spice on the tail end.		A beautiful caramel begins at the front of my tongue, followed up by some butter rum lifesavers and sweet bready malt. Seems pretty malty, but then the hops liven up the party with a healthy dose of pine, grapefruit, raw bitterness and earth. Finishes clean and peppery, with a slightly alcoholic finish.		Loving the mouthfeel on this beer. It's got a perfect medium consistency with a nice head texture, perfect carbonation, and the right finish.		This is a very balanced IPA, but it's still pretty big and bold. I enjoyed this a lot more than Caldera's Pale Ale. It's not a terribly refreshing IPA, but it was a pleasure to drink, and delivered exactly what I was looking for. Overall, a strong example of the classic American IPA style.

review/text: on tap at Uber Tavern, poured in a standard pint.		A - Amber-gold with nice off-white head that leaves pretty decent lace sticking all over the glass.		S - snappy pine and citrus rind.		T - Pine resinous and bitter herbal hops with nice grainy backbone. 		M - nice coating medium body with risp carbonation and fry finish.		D - Fairly layered for a somewhat straight forward flavor profile, revealing itself over time which makes it more drinkable than it seems at first.

review/text: Can into Sam Adams Sensory glass. 		Pours clear, bright copper, dark enough that it ventures almost into ruby hues in the wider sections of the glass. Head is huge, towering at at least 3 fingers of dense off-white goodness, and taking a good while to settle back down. Tons and tons of delicate lacing covering the walls of the glass as the head recedes.		Nose comes through as direct but very well done - big grapefruity citrus hops sit on top of a light bed of toasty caramel, really well put together and refined. 		Taste is very, very good. World class even. Grapefruity hops come through big to start, though this one is all flavor and almost no bitterness - hopbursted? - with a firm layer underneath of toasty caramel malt that is just in absolute perfect balance for an IPA. The hops are clearly the star of the show, but the malt is just dialed in to perfection. Wow. Finish starts with a big juicy-sweet grapefruit burst, and carries a very manageable bitterness that never builds out of control as the finish dries right up.		Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium-full bodied, maybe just a tiny bit sticky. Really exceptionally done. 		Drinkability is startlingly good, up there with my best IPA experiences. A really top-tier IPA that I'd heard a lot about, but really wasn't expecting to be as good as it is. Tip of the hat to the folks at Caldera, beautifully done beer.

review/text: 12oz can poured into a pint glass.		A thick mat of nearly-white head collapses to a still-impressive thin, but dense cap on top of a clear copper body.		Bright, citric hops like fresh lime zest and juicy orange with just a touch of pine. Plenty of malt character too with a solid dose of warm, toasted Munich malt. Caramel is there too but it just smooths out the edges of the beer and softens the blow of the supposed 90+ IBUs. Speaking of which, this IPA drinks more like a 60 IBU beer thanks to the malt support, which can be good or bad depending on your hoppy beer imbibing preferences. I, personally, like my IPAs both ways. More balanced seems to work well for a beer only pushing 6% ABV.		A great beer in a can. Not such a rarity these days, but still nice to see. The only detractor is the $11/sixer price, which makes it hard for this to compete with some of the bigger hop-happy brewers like Sierra Nevada.

review/text: Caldera's IPA is about as close to a session beer as I have found (the price tag and ABV get in the way a bit), with the perfect combination of flavor and smoothness.		A: Deep orange-amber, about as dark as you'll see an IPA. Thick, creamy 1/2 head doesn't go away. Excellent lacing. Rising bubbles. 		S: Standout. Powerful citrus and pine overwhelm the nose. I could smell this beer all day. 		T: Doesn't quite live up to the smell, but starts out strong and only improves as it warms. Hop bitterness is there but doesn't interfere in the least with the gorgeous grapefruit and pine flavors.		M: A slightly dry, bitter finish is the only downpoint here. While it's in the mouth, this baby is heaven.		D: As I said, this is about as eminently drinkable as a 50+ IBU, 6.1% ABV can get. I could pound three of these 12 oz. cans in a half hour without batting an eye.

review/text: A= pours a dark orange-brown leathery hue. The head is cream colored and airy, with lacing that clinged to the sides of the wine glass I used for the tasting.		S= Piney hops, as expected. Some floral notes and grapefruit.		T= Again the pine, but the grapefruit shows up stronger then the nose suggests. The hops are out front, but not the least bit aggresive. A touch of malt in the backbone evens things out and holds the hops in check.		M= Light bodied. Smooth and a bit creamy for an IPA. Carbonation is light. The bitterness of the hops linger, but in a more subdued way than other IPAs I have tried.		D= This is an IPA I could drink all day. Not too filling, not too bitter, well balanced.

review/text: Now available in NC, and now I can see it and smell it the score went up. A really great canned IPA for the pool /beach or really anywhere. I also like Avery IPA, and Modus in cans, but I would have to give this brew a leg up on either, a little more fruit and hops than the others and at 6.1 ABV really drinkable. Not terribly bitter either, so it would makea great IPA for anyone who wants to step up ftom PA's to IPA's.		Also found the last sixer in Myrtle Beach on the shelf, and what a great surprise. Not only the only the only canned IPA available but a damn tasty one, Drank it out of the can so I have no idea on what it looked like, smelled like or any kinda head retention, but I loved it. I also had some Modus, but Caldera was definitely a little more fruity. IMO a real find, and a real solid A kinda brew. Would have scored higher if not being guzzled at the beach which knocked down the appearance and nose, Drink ability is good but the ABV in the killer heat had to be respected although not a heavyweight in this dept

Smelled nice and hoppy and fruity small bit of floral.Taste was straight up IPA wich is a great thing in my book.Mouth was smooth and pleasant with a nice amount of hops bitterness.These babies have a drinkability that is very nice,went down real nice in the heat and the cans were a big plus for transportation.Wish this brew was around my area!!!!

review/text: A solid IPA in a can? You betcha!		Beautiful, brilliantly clear coppery orange beer with a thick cap of ivory bubbles that lasts throughout the whole drink. Wonderful sticky lacing. Nose is full of strong citrus hops, with grapefruit and orange the leading flavors. Note, as the beer warms, a mild diacetyl butteriness becomes noticeable. Very hopforward, with a nice malt backbone. Citrus hops pack a punch throughout, with some big bitterness and some resiny characteristics on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, with a resiny finish that mildly detracts from the brew. Overall a very drinkable hop bomb, a true big northwest IPA.

review/text: Can. Great for shooting empty bottles in the desert. Orange color. Yummy dry hop aroma, fruity too.		Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all.

review/text: A - Seems a little funny to review a canned beer by appearance since we can't see it and it goes directly from the can and right down the hatch!		Pours an amber orange color with a creamy one fingered head. The foam dies down gradually but keeps an even layer on top. Moderate amount of carbonation.		S - All I'm getting is delicate citrus, bisquit, and caramel. Not overly aromatic for an IPA and I'm having an unusually hard time picking up any other nuances.		T - Light caramel biscuity malt, with a little bit of sugary sweetness at the front of the tongue. The tongue is greeted with caramel malt and almost immediately after is hit with the citrus hopping to keep the sweetness in perfect check. There's a caramel-like grapefruit bitterness left in the mouth and eventually, nothing but grapefruit bitterness after the sweetness dies down.		M - Slightly on the heavier side of medium bodied, smooth feel as it rolls over the tongue with the carbonation being more on the creamy side than prickly.		D - Very, very good. 		Very finely balanced. I din't like it at first so I waited to have a second can on a different day to give it a fair chance. I have to say it's growing on me. At 6.1%, I could drink these all day, a nice change up from the high octane beers.

review/text: 12Oz can purchased from 'Beers of Europe' here in the UK. Poured the beer into a 'Hoegaarden' Grand Cru glass.		looked good, huge cream coloured head sat on top of a dull, hazy, dark amber/orange body. The head produced some heavy lacing and tried to stay throughout the tasting.		The nose was of yeasts and hops along with some grain type esters.		The hops from the aroma take over the taste completely, a real bitterness hits the mouth and throat. Why do they (or is it you?) have to over hop everything in the US when they brew an IPA? There really is no need to do so. It isn't as bad (hop wise) as some I've reviewed, but still too hoppy for my tender tastebuds.		It is true to the American IPA style and I think one of the better examples I've had (I am not a huge fan of the style though).

review/text: Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007.		Hooray! for canned craft beer. We really love this format and how quickly it is spreading throughout the US. Options are great, especially when you are in no glass zones such as poolside, on a boat, on the beach--and also simply for the fact that the can is a great space saver. 		Stodgy off-white head, the sticky mass shows its great retention as it stays strong all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Clear copper-penny hue; a few bubbles race to the top. Citric, pine and black tea hop aroma. Hint of melon, estery alcohol and sweet toasted malt in the background. Lots of smoothness to go around--extremely smooth. Slightly chewy medium body shows the malt is not just going to sit back while getting pummeled by the hops. Mild cookie-like sweetness from the malt has a faint toasted graininess to it. Hops come in with a controlled but precise bitterness, strong but still leaving some balance. Big minty hop flavor very slowly dissipates with citric rind, evergreen, black tea leaves and a sweet Mandarin orange flavor. Finishes a little bittersweet with a rock-solid hop flavor and sweet biscuity maltiness. 		This is a great example if you are looking to try a Pacific Northwest (PNW) India Pale Ale. Hops all around, both in bitterness and flavor, with enough malt to keep everything in balance. Nothing over the top. It's simply a great IPA--and it's in a can.

review/text: Finally starting to see this much hyped brewery show up here in the Fourth Corner. The Amber and Pale I tried weren't all that thrilling so I didn't have much in the way of expectations for the IPA. Well it turned out to be just an average example of the style. It's worth a shot if you see it, but it's not great.

review/text: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.

review/text: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.

review/text: This IPA pours a clear amber/orange with one finger of foam that dissipates quickly.		Aroma is hops, floral and citrusy, with a nice roasted/toasted malt backbone. I pick up grapefruit, flowers, a touch of herbs and grass and a bit of musk smell that I associate with Columbus hops, a nice fresh hop aroma. The malt has a very noticeable toasted/biscuit note, much more up front than many IPAs.		Taste is quite smooth overall, the biscuity malt balances nicely with the hop bitterness. It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor. The finish is remnants of biscuity malts and some hop bitterness and citrus. Overall, even a minute after I take a sip, the toasty malt is the dominant flavor on the finish. Quite nice.		Mouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation.		Overall I very much enjoyed this beer, a big IPA with a strong malt base yet substantial hop flavor. This beer stands out to me among the Northwest IPAs I have tried, it has a very nice balance and a smooth flavor.

review/text: Their website says Simcoe, Centennial and Amarillo hops, and the malts are Premium Two-Row, Munich and Crystal.		A= pours a cloudy dark yellow-orange, big fluffy slurpy head, plenty of lacing.		S= generous whiffs of nice rich malts, hops florals in the citrus range.		T= grapefruity hops with orange/tangerine as a close second; thick complex quality malts, slightly bready, a small touch of honey. Decent bitters but nicely balanced into the blend. Outstanding. 		M= complex hops bitters, complex malts, slightly chewy, lingering for enjoyment for a while.		D= very drinkable although it might become a bit filling after a few. Thanks to the outstanding taste, however, I could probably force a few more ha ha.

review/text: This beer pours a very lovely copper amber color with a fluffy, sticky, slightly off-white head. The aroma is typical American IPA with plenty of grapefruit, orange, pine and caramel malt aroma. The taste is hop forward yet pretty well balanced with tons of hop flavor and bitterness, but a decent malt backbone to hold it up. Flavors are similar to the nose with grapefruit, orange, pine forest and caramel malt sweetness with a bit of toastyness as well. Medium bodied with a great finish that is not too sticky or dry and lingers just long enough. Very drinkable and a great, sessionable IPA.

review/text: Thanks to a good friend of mine for leaving me with a few cans of this beer. 12 ounce can poured into a stemmed glass.		A: Rich amber in color with a thick off-white head that settles quickly to a thin film on the surface. Slight chill haze exists, and carbonation is lively. Head retention is low, but lacing is very nice.		S: Somewhat dulled at first, but as the beer warms a bit the hops and malt shine through at the same time. Floral piney hops balance out with sweet caramel-like malt. 		T: Very floral and fruity with resinous hop notes, along with hints of pine and citrus. Malt character is mild, but there are hints of caramel, toast, and dried fruit in the backround. It's a very balanced beer.		M & D: Medium bodied and full of flavor. The mouthfeel is quite silky and the finish is clean, but long lasting. Caldera has made a truly remarkable IPA here. Hopefully I'll be able to try this one again in the future. Easy drinking, tasty, and since it comes in a can, it's very boat friendly.

review/text: A: Poured from a can into the Duvel tulip. Dark orange, amber and nearing a light brown. Reddish tones. Head is fairly thin and fizzy.		S: Smells fantastic. Big piney hops along with a nice malt backbone. A bit of tart citrus and some grapefruit. Some peaches and grapes.		T: Good hop bitterness, sweet fruits from the nose turn into rather bitter fruits on the palate. Grapefruit and some unripe orange. Citrus rind and zest. 		M: Slick and a bit malty on the tongue. Carbonation is just about right, doesn't bite back quite enough.		D: Easily drinkable beer, love the hop/malt balance, especially for a west coast IPA. Great beer that I continue to revisit.

review/text: Specs: Simcoe, Centennial, and Amarillo hops, with 94 IBUs...definitely looking forward to this		A: Pours a semi-transparent amber/copper color. The eggshell head is real fluffy and big. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick sheet of foam on top throughout the duration of the drink.		S: Very pungent nose; tropical fruits like pineapple and slight mango, piny resinous hops, and slight earthy undertones. Citrus (grapefruit and slight orange and lemon peel) is also apparent. Alcohol peeks through the nose a little bit, but doesn't take away from anything. Malts give a firm base and seem like they will balance nicely.		T: A little different from the nose...the 94 IBUs really shine and give off a puckering bitterness. Earthy, resinous, and citric hops make up a majority of the flavor. I don't know exactly what gives this flavor off (I have the same thing in my dry hopped IPA that was brewed a few weeks ago) but it tastes like the smell of whole hop flowers- slightly vegetal...I did dry hop with Simcoe so maybe thats where it comes from. Malts lend a caramel and toffee backing that helps to balance, but seems to be consumed by the hop bombardment. 		MF/D: Smooth and creamy feel. Pretty big body for the style. Carbonation is awesome- at the ideal level in my book. Not necessarily a complete palate killer, but close to it. This makes for a good outdoor occasion IPA.		Notes: Solid IPA. Typical of the west coast style- bitter and resinous. Great tailgate or beach beer

Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel.		Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well.		Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish.

review/text: Pours a brilliant, shimmering honey color. Very generous off white head, sticks around with good lacing.		Smells like im sticking my head in a barrel of fresh hops. very floral and earthy, some citrus. the hop presence in the smell of this beer is assertive and strong.		Taste gives way to fresh, juicy grapefruit and resinous pine. Extremely vibrant. Definitely hop forward, not a lot of malt to explore in this one. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is nice and moderate. Has a nice flowing, juicy feel to it in the mouth, I can tell this beer is very fresh.		Highly drinkable, I'll get right down to it and say this is an excellent IPA I could drink all evening. They did a great job on this beer, i'd consider it in the class of the best IPAs I've had.	This is also my introduction to craft beer in a can, very impressed all in all.

review/text: Big thanks to Bobby8405 for the share		A - Pours a hazy amber-copper hue, with a rocky off-white head.		S - Some citrus-y and evergreen hop aroma is available, but it is pretty tame.		T - The flavor is much more potent than the aroma. There is a very classic West Coast dankness that is melded at first with the rich malt, but then separates itself and stands apart, with great herbal and leafy hop flavors lingering intensely on the finish.		M - IPA. Good.		D - Not the best of the West, but pretty good.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a tulip glass. Have drank this many (many) times and decided to finally rate it.		A: Color is a dark yellow/gold, almost bordering on a pale orange. Pours with a decent (1 1/2 inch) white head. Head is dense and disippated slowly.		S: As expected, lots of hops are very noticable - citrus (grapefruit, orange), floral, pine, etc. Quite a wide range of hop flavors, actually.		T: Taste continues where smell left off - lots of hops. Good citrus, floral and piney hops are evident throughout the taste with only some minor malt flavors present. Finish is a touch bitter, with some of the hop flavors fading, leaving just some bitterness behind.		M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, finishes dry.		D: Excellent. The perfect summer picnic or camping beer. I've consumed cases of this stuff and find it a very drinkable. It is well balanced, bitterness is in check, and you can consume several of these without being overwhelmed.

review/text: Wow, the canned IPAs just keep coming my way... and they can continue to do so! I cannot complain. New to my blighted and "Famously Hot" city of Columbia - the heart of Darkness of South Carolina - Caldera IPA is a welcome reminder that I once lived, nay, was even born in the Pacific Northwest.... and someday may be blessed to return.		The Caldera can itself is a rather ugly yellow with lots of hop cones around a, uh, caldera (cauldron) and the whole thing is rather an affront to the eyes, perhaps designed by a 2nd year art student who dropped out to smoke dope and lie on the beach with his rotund black lab and pierced girlfriend, but what do I know.		Caldera IPA is a dull, clear deep yellow, with a nice head that never really dies and some nice sticky lace. Smells good, but not great - pungent and resiny West-Coast-Yo hops, malt is regulated to the background. Grapefruit and some citrusy fruit, a smack of booze. Taste is similar, more hop-bitter forward, a bit thin, sweet but not terribly characterful malt. No real surprises here, but it's not bad. A fine finish, adequate carbonation and some finishing hop bitterness turn this into a pretty solid IPA.		Caldera can't quite hang with the big dogs, and at a price of $12 a six pack has to do a little more to justify itself in my mind. This is a good IPA, but the world is rife with good IPAs... I would gladly drink this anytime, but if my distributor is reading this, man, have you seen what $12 buys you on the streets of Ashland these days?

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into my New Belgium tulip glass...		appearance - cloudy orange-gold with an off-white head that dissipates slightly as it sits. lacing is quite nice though - by the end of the glass, i could find the exact level the beer originally poured to.		aroma - pineapple & marmalade hops. honey as well.		taste - hops taste as they smelled -- slightly bitter & citrus. good malt balance. finish is nice & dry.		mouthfeel - fairly full bodied.		drinkability - quite high. full flavored, but light enough to enjoy more if you'd like. i've had a few of these the last couple weeks at my kickball games. makes for a great portable craft choice.		newly available to those of us in south carolina, this is a tasty choice for those looking for a brew with both full flavor and the portability of a can. will most assuredly enjoy again.

review/text: I like the 12 oz can size. Sometimes 22oz is just more than I want. 		Pour was smooth, moderate carbonation. Gold in color. Hazy. 		Very nice fruity, hoppy smell. Enjoy the grapefruit smell while raising to your nose.		Taste was very well balanced for IPA. Hoppy but not out of control. Very nice mouth feel, which makes this a very drinkable beer. White head, with a moderate lacing. This is a good beer. I would describe it as a, "very drinkable" beer. Enjoy!

review/text: A: Slightly hazy golden amber with a nice off-white head and moderate to heavy lacing.		S: Nice mix of mild citrus, pine and floral scents. Very mild malty sweet scent too.		T&M: Very well-balanced, medium bodied IPA. Mostly floral hops with a mild background of citrus and pine. Perfect mild malty sweetness that cancels out most hop bitterness, but leaves the best components of the hops.		This stuff is great for a canned beer. Period.	Easier to store in the fridge, lighter and really very good. Joe at Green's mentioned that it is similar to 'Two Hearted'. I agree that it is just as good, but a little hoppier with less malty sweetness. I need to try another to confirm, but at first try, it's a definite regular on my list. Way to go Caldera!

review/text: A - Pours a nice translucent darker orange with a nice finger of off white/light caramel colored head, poured ~20+ minutes ago, still has a nice layer of head. Lacing is dense. Awesome		S - Lots of citrusy hop aromas, a little bit of malty caramel sweetness. Grapefruit and oranges dominate		T - Really bold, bitter and citrusy. Simple but very well balanced		M - Medium bodied at a warmish 50-55 degrees. When cold its somewhere between light and medium bodied. Refreshing, drinkable, nicely carbonated		O - This is a great IPA, can't believe I've never noticed this one before, definitely worth grabbing from time to time

review/text: Poured into DFH pint glass. Looks like a nice fresh hop IPA, such as Celebration. Murky orange/copper poured to a half inch creamy head. Love the lacing as it disappears down my gullet...		Aroma wafting toward me reveals all the IPA scents: citrus, pine, with a hint of rising bread.		Many of the previous reviews state a syrupy consistency, and I agree it is syrupy, however, if your a DIPA lover, you won't mind it a bit. Chugs more like a DIPA which I love.	You'll get whacked up front with a nice citrus profile before a light sweet malt and lingering bitterness take over. The bitterness is just right leading you to raise your glass in another slug creating a nice drinkabillity which many IPAs do not nail.		Carbo is a touch soft which is my only knock here, but like I said the feel is heavier like a DIPA 		Overall, this is a great IPA and will absolutely have again...

review/text: 12oz can poured into a chilled Founders pint glass.		A: Pours a dark orange color with a nice white, frothy head that recedes very slowly. Excellent lacing retention throughout the glass.		S: Huge tropical notes up front with grapefruit being the main scent. I also can smell traces of pine and some orange and malt.		T: I taste more orange than the scent gives off. Not as much pine and or grapefruit as the scent had suggested. This beer has a massive sweet malt backbone.		M: A bit too syrupy for my liking, medium bodied and it has nice carbonation.		O: Not what I look for in an IPA and quite honestly for the price not worthy of an elite IPA status IMO.

review/text: Poured into a tulip. Color is of a lighter golden with a fluffy off white colored heading. A little hazy in color but does have a nice lively action look to it.		Nose was toned down a bit for me. More of malty caramel sweetness hits the nostrils followed with a subtle touch of grapefruit and grass.		Taste was extremely sweet at first of a heavy walloping malty gooey-ness of a backbone. Nice bitterness, grassy and zesty taste. Finishes with a hop grind makes me think of pure hop oil.		Mouth is medium bodied,good carbonation, a little bit on the thick syrupy side. Nice kiss of stickiness on the lips from the hop residue.		A solid IPA. A bit heavy for my liking when I think of IPA but for the malt IPA lovers this is your baby.

review/text: Huge thanks to mages64 & psiweaver for hitting a perma-want in the partners BIF!		A  Orangey-rust with a fantastic fluffy cream colored head. Great head retention which hangs around for a good 10 minutes. There are two fairly prominent floaties in here; not sure if they're hops, or pieces of Oregon.		S  The aroma is a little subdued, but what I'm getting out of it, I like. Lots of really earthy pinecones and trees, orange marmalade, light grass and a fair amount of caramel dipped bread.		T  I don't see a date on the can, but I think this might be on the older side. BUT, being just over the hill doesn't stop this from being delicious. The hop profile is on the mild side, but maintains for the entire taste with fresh cut grass, lemon soda, barely bitter grapefruit and spruce. The malt that backs all of that up comes out in toasted nuts, lightly sweet caramel, hearty rye bread. There is a really nice balance going on here  while I would like the hops to stand up a little more, the malt profile is still second fiddle. But even though the malt characteristics take a backseat to the hops, the nut+caramel bread combo is fantastic.		M  No problems here  medium bodied, a touch on the syrupy side with an understated carbonation pop.		O  Easily a beer I could drink by the six pack. Also would be good for a newer ipa drinker who need some malt balance and isn't bitter to the point of no return.

Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.

review/text: Picked up a 6er of this, cool lookin can! On sale for 8.99 I believe. Normal is 10 bucks I believe. Poured into a frozen pint glass right from the fridge.		A- Pours an orange dark straw color. Good lookin'! LACING is great in this beer! O so sticky!		S- HOPS HOPS and more fresh picked fruity HOPS. From past experience with this beer I know everything improves as it warms up. Very beer-like smell. Also lots of grain as well. Great smell		T- Starts with a very short great malt and grain taste then right into a delicious fresh hop flavor that reminds me of the smell of picking a ripe hop bud right off the bine! Lasts for some good time. I dare say the most profound fresh hop flavor I've ever tasted in a IPA, it literally tastes like you put some hops in your mouth and started chewing it up and its great. Very full flavored. 		M- Medium, not too light but not heavy. 		O- A great IPA, I am not the biggest fan of piney IPAs but this one has just a touch of it then followed by fruity hops (my preference). A for sure thumbs up from me. Darn near my most fav IPA. Pick some up, you will enjoy if your an IPA fan.

Very strong and pungent aromas of citrusy grapefruit hops all the way here... Very very citrusy aromas here, very West Coast as others have said... This smells ridiculously delicious...		Juicy citrusy hops explode across the palate right off the bat and finish with a lingering grapefruit finish that has me ready for each successive sip... Very delicious IPA here... Its juicy as hell, grapefruit, pineapple, orange... All mixed in together... Really nice...		Overall, a truly classic IPA and one that I will be buying regularly from now on..

review/text: Poured from a can that looks like Jerry Garcia lives inside it, this beer is bright copper with a bone white head that has good retention and lacing.		Aroma is sweet tangerine, orange, and light floral notes from the hops. It has a light crystal malt sweetness with hints of caramel.		Flavor is big citrus hops; tangerine skin, navel orange, pink grapefruit and a hint of sticky pine. Moderate malt sweetness does the balancing act for a suberbly drinkable IPA that is very much in the West Coast style. 		Medium bodied, slick and creamy mouthfeel leaves you wanting for another sip, er gulp. Very balanced and very drinkable.

S: A nice aroma of citrus, hops, and a slight maltiness.		T: Tasted of hops, pine, citrus, and some caramel malt. A very Western-type flavor for an IPA.		M: A well-carbonated beer with a dry, crisp finish. Medium-bodied.		D: A very drinkable beer that helps to dispell the myth that only bad beers come in cans.

review/text: Poured from the brightly colored Grateful Dead concert poster-esque can into a shaker pint glass: deep orange, with a snowy white, one finger head that dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves some nice patches of lace. Aroma is dominated by citrus hops - there's also some bread crust and caramel malt in there. Taste is grapefruity, and a touch piney in the finish - some malt sweetness towards the finish, too. Mouthfeel is about medium-bodied and creamy... although it feels like something is missing -maybe a bit more body. A very drinkable IPA - can't wait to take a few to the beach soon...

review/text: Recently picked up a sixer on the boss's dollar for a company opening day tailgate - not out of character that I was the only one to enjoy one at the time. But this is my first poured into a pint, getting a good look nad whiff. 		Pours a pretty amber, with a good 1/4" of off-white head - and while it dies down, I can already tell that it's going to leave a good lace. 		The nose seems somewhat muted, but I can pick up grapefruit, and a bit of pine. 		Somewhat bracing in its bitterness - significant grapefruit that really lasts. A very crisp pine flavor comes through as well. Quite hoppy, but no associated burn. 		A little viscous on the tongue, tucking into each crevasse in the mouth. Good carbonation - really leads the tongue to enjoy the hoppiness. 		I think I enjoyed it better from the can while on the parking lot before a baseball game earlier this week - there was something really refreshing about enjoying a good beer from a can, right along side a brat off the grill. Either way, an easy drinker.

review/text: Poured from a can into a nonic pint glass.		A: A medium copper amber color with a nice one finger white head. Nice full glass lacing.		S: Citrus smells with some floral notes and a sweet malt smell after the hops. Yummy fresh smelling hops are jumping.		T: Citrus is the first flavor with tastes of grapefruit, lemon, orange and mango coupled with some herbal floral flavors which is then followed up by the sweet caramel malt. The sweetness is taken over by bitterness towards the end as I get some spicy pepper flavors on the back with some minty qualities. Bitterness is the finish that lingers on. Nice balanced IPA.		M: Medium, prickly, bitter, coating and hidden alcohol.		D: High, these are really nice and are very enjoyable. You can drink a few of these.		Overall a real nice IPA from a can, maybe the second best one out there right now if I don't count OB Gordon (Furious beat all). Very west coast stylistic in a can no less. That makes it very unique and very good.

review/text: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks!		This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts.		Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely.		The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish.		In the mouth this one is nice and creamy.		This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.

review/text: Pour - bright, bright, glowing orange and yellow in color. Wow, it is a sight to behold. Big, fluffy, stark white head rests on top protecting the "goods".	 	Aroma - pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange, lemon, powdered sugar and caramel malt. Lots of nice citrus and tropical fruit flavors but not so much piney-ness. 	 	Taste - graprefuity, tropical fruity, bittersweet and tongue drying. Plenty of malty sweetness backing up this dry mouth inducing IPA. The hop profile is very pungent and fresh coming from the can and this one lives up to its billing as one of the better canned IPAs on the market (of which there are more and more). Great job to all those at Caldera! Keep up the good work and I look forward to trying your other canned offerings. 	 	Overall - great IPA in a can! Very drinkable and well balanced (which is what really makes this one stand out). Fresh hop flavors is well preserved in the can and the overall drinkability is excellent.	 	Would I buy more of it? - Well, I was lucky enough to get a few cans of this via several trades so its not so much a matter of buying it again as it is getting it through other means again. That being said, if I am ever out in Oregon I'd love to check out the brewery in Ashland and maybe force myself to drink more of that "lithia" water.

Smell was pine and citrus. Hard candy sweetness. Yummy.		Taste reflected the aroma pretty well. Bright grassy hops and sweet enough clean, malty grains. Tropical fruit. There was a long lingering aftertaste of green hops. Spot on!		Mouthfeel was medium with plenty of carbonation. Moderately lush in the mouth. Nice.

It must be the can, the hop fresh flavors are off the charts with plenty of juicy grapefruit and orange backed with enough caramel malt to balance but still be hop forward. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. A really nice session IPA.

review/text: Poured from a small bright can into my Corsedonk snifter. Pours a nice looking copper color with nice size frothy white head. Decent head retention and lacing, but the lacing slides pretty quickly down the glass.		Aroma is hoppy! This one smells sweet and bitter...like a DIPA. Notes of orange, lemon, and hops. Mouthwatering...		Hmm, not such a good taste. One of those IPA's that is just bitter, no sweet taste to counterbalance, and very very dry finish. Just hops on the tongue. I can somehow taste a very faint sweetness trying to come through, but the hops just over-power it. Light and crisp mouthfeel with a ton of carbonation. Not a beer I'll be having again...

review/text: Another great lookin IPA in a can, becoming a new trend I guess. Got this one thanks to my first trade with womencantsail.		A: The pour into my oversized snifter rises a fluffy head of over 1 finger. It's a semi clear slightly darker amber reddish almost flourescent color.		N: Lots of fresh hops. Loaded with pine and citrus, just as a west coast IPA should be. Little bit of chewy and earthy hops, and hints of musty fresh wet hops and hop oils. A very light sweet malt aroma dusts it as well.		T: A big bitter bite. Lots of earthy musty spicy hops with some hop oil and fresh wet hop flavors. Some pine and grapefruit, a little more citrus, and chewy hops. Pretty bitter, or more than I expected. A slight sweet malt touch just for a little roundedness. 		M: Some spicy hops and some oils, a good body and good carbonation.		F: The bitterness builds a little on the finish, and just ramps up to a nice peak and lingers there for a bit. The musty fresh wet hop flavors, pale hops, and earthy hop flavors seem to linger for a while, with a touch of pine. A little orange peel bitterness hits as well. A nice IPA, some good hop flavors, but a little too musty and bitter, orange peel bitterness.

review/text: The beer pours a hazy dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.

review/text: Tastes like a hopped grapefruit, which sounds terrible but drinks pretty nice. Citrus is not overwhelming, but it's in there. I think I prefer my citrus lean toward lemon, but this is fine. Frankly, the best reason to drink this is the vessel. Drink outside by the grill on a sunny day. Go cans.

review/text: A: Medium bronze-amber body. Large frothy, off-white head. Moderate retention. Nice crunchy lacing left behind.		S: Blend of grapefruit, pine and floral hop bitterness. Bready malts and a light caramel underbelly.		T: Up front, there is a nice pine bitterness that transitions towards a subtle citrus tone in the finish. Bread and caramel malts are present throughout. Moderate bitterness in the finish.		M: Smooth, medium bodied. Carbonation maintained its form from the first pour. Constant roll of bubbles on the tongue. Clean, crisp finish. Slightly sweet from the malts.		D: Overall, a very nice offering. The overall hop presentation was not quite as "fresh" as I was expecting, but this is a good product and its nice to see it available in a can.

review/text: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing.		S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. 		T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be.		M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. 		D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.

review/text: A stunner in a can		A deep color of honey, painted on a desert mountainside at sunrise. Plenty of frothy sticky icky lace - whitish, messy and organic like foam off the ocean. A lingering head that leaves plenty of webbed lacing down the glass.		Smells like an artists interpretation of hydroponic marijuana. Incredibly dank, backed by a tight jolt of crystalline sugar. Smells of wild fields of flora and fauna. In my head I am brought to my knees, imbibing in nature's melody. In for one more whiff... DANK! High in the nostril a hint of potently sweet floral hopiness surfaces and then disappears. Wow.		That nose is expressed well in the mouth. Starts wet and slightly sweet, attaining a Noble hop bite on the front of the tongue. Low sweet caramel notes hold things briefly in check but the hopiness only continues to grow from the front to back. In the middle a plethora of fruity notes emerge - grapefruit, lemons and oranges. In the next flash though its the earthier, piney hop that begins to shine. By it's finish the show is brutally bitter - it 'Arcs' only as it finishes. A puckering bitterness that again brings to mind the wild tastes of a forest. Hops are pooling on all sides of my mouth with pine-like bitterness. My tongue is buckling, and I'm wondering if I'm as much of a hop head as I think I am. The hops are imposing their will on my senses, and I'm starting to beg for mercy. The brewer has fortunately carbonated the hell out of this beer. The hydrophobic (read: oily) resins are minimized by all the surface area provided by these bubbles. This produces a light/medium body with a lot of texture. I am catching an alcohol heat in the back of the throat that is not totally pleasant. Drinkable, HUGE, challenging.

review/text: A 12 ounce can from a sixer I picked up at Abe's for $11. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The IPA appears a super clear golden amber color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a nice looking lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of bready, caramel malt, perfume, a bit of bitter grapefruit pith, lime, lemon, lightly toasted rolls. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. I thought this would be super fresh and hoppy since this brewery just came into PA a week or so ago. I was a bit let down, especially judging by the reviews here. Needs more hops...

review/text: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a huge creamy white head. Huge floral and citrus nose with some bready malt notes. Flavor is dominated by Perfume/floral/citrus hop flavor, and a great bitterness to caramel/toasty malt profile. Moderate carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. This was delicious, thanks adamharbaugh for the opportunity.

review/text: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.

Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. 		M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. 		D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.

review/text: 12oz CAN into a regular kitchen glass, looking forward to this one.		Caldera IPA boasts a kinda bright orange with some shiny bronze shades within. A clean looking beer with no haze at all. Two fingaz worth of off white foam that is quite creamy looking and condensed. A bunch of lace on the glass.		The hops take up most of the nose with a big grapefruit bite and some pale malts to back it up with a sweet scent, slight caramel. Not very bold but smells like the makings of a decent IPA.		Tropical fruit on top of a nice malty layer. Grapefruit, pineapple, others, some bisquit giving malt. I'm really liking the balance on this, it's pretty much even. Some grassy earth towards the end. This really reminds me of Lagunitas IPA.		The feel is smooth and a bit bitter, but nothing too much. Carb is just right not very high or overly crisp, I could drink this all day.

review/text: Poured from a can that says: "keep cool, just like you"... into a Surly pint glass. 		A: Standard pour yields a 1 finger fluffy white head with poor retention, leaving a rather thick, patchy white film floating at the top. Beer is a clear reddish orange. Lacing is frothy, layered, appropriate for a beer this style. 		S: Cane sugar, citrus, piney hops. Fresh but very subtle. Not an overwhelming nose by any measure. Slight sourness is also detectable. 		T: Opens very crisp, refreshing. Piney hop character presents itself towards the middle as the beer warms a bit. Citrus and cane sugar sweetness is present at the back but is overtaken quickly by an astringent, hoppy bite. Finish is a leafy bitterness, as if I've chewed	a hop nugget. Aggressive! 		M: Light bodied, good carbonation but rather smooth. Watery and very refreshing though the finish is a bit overwhelming which takes away from the feel a bit. 		D: Light bodied and crispness make this beer more drinkable than it should be. A very unbalanced IPA in my opinion which is not for me, but nevertheless appreciable. I'd reach for it if it was around, but this is a one shot deal for me. A solid beer.

review/text: Served from a 12oz. can acquired in a trade as an extra with volatilesther (Thanks!) into my Stone Levitation tulip at the appropriate temperature (02/02/10).		A: Pours a slightly hazy, darker shade of golden, amber with three fingers of an off-white head with great retention and some sticky and patchy lacing.		S: Nice aroma of bitter, citrus hops along with a slight caramel and bready malt backbone.		T: Clean and fresh taste of bitter hops with some citrus tones and layers of a bready, caramel malt. Simple, straightforward, yet pleasing and well done flavor profile. 		M: On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate and slick/creamy carbonation and a hint of lingering bitterness on the way down. 		D: very drinkable as it is well balanced, clean and fresh. 		Overall this was a solid American IPA from Caldera and one that is quite sessionable. Thanks again Esther!

review/text: Thanks to kels for hooking me up with a can of this in a recent in-person trade. Pour is from the can to a pint glass.		Appearance: Pours a pretty vibrant copper color and starts with about a 1 finger of slightly off-white head that fades to a pretty full and thick skim; body is clear and shows strong carbonation; a prety full curtain of lacing holds tight to the sides of the glass.		Smell: A lot of nice and bitter hops like a good IPA should have - tons of pine and bitter citric fruit peel. Straightforward, no questions to be asked.		Taste: I'm impressed - Caldera's Pale Ale was a real let down, but this is quite solid; lots of bitter hops right up front -- very piney and that citric fruit peel that is oh so nice and bitter and not juicy at all (not that juicy is bad either, but this one is straight up bitter); faint malt presence offers a little bit of sweetened balance, but the bitter dominates; fairly strong metallic aftertaste, but it's still really good and doesn't downplay the solid flavors too much.		Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation makes it feel very crisp and lively; body isn't thin, but not quite thick either -- about where I would like an IPA; a nice stickiness from all that hop resin coats the roof of the mouth quite nicely. 		Drinkability: Actually, I could probably drink this all day; nice solid bitter flavor with a crisp and refreshing body; would be great for a hot summer day, but I can't complain about drinking it when it's 15 degrees outside either...

review/text: The server ate my original review, so let's try this again:		Poured from a 12oz can into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. 		ECE/SAE amber colored liquid with three fingers of solid soapy seashell foam which recedes to a thin but persistent layer leaving agressive lacing behind resembling a mackerel sky with tiny clouds embedded in faint legs. Brilliant clarity.		While there is strong citrus in the nose (with tell-tale orange zest), the Simcoe hops seem the most pronounced of the three utilized, with their distinctive forest-floor/pine contribution. There is also an herbal borderline "catty" note that I didn't notice the last time I tried this beer (though since it is canned I don't think it was light-struck!).		Mint, orange pith, and pine needles on the palate with an undercurrent of pale malt. Unripe citrus bitterness with a bit of lemon/lime but no grapefruit. Finishes rather dry and faintly toasty. A little less pronounced malt that many NW IPAs - though more than most IPAs from SoCal.		Zippy, resinous, and highly carbonated - this is quite refreshing. An excellent choice for car camping or a fishing trip.

review/text: Pours copper with a rich off-white head. Trailing lace nearly covers the glass.		The smell is of pine, herbal spicing, some medicinal notes, perfumy, with orange and grapefruit. A nice, complex hop aroma!		The taste is of an herbal, aspirin-ish, bitterness with grapefruit and orange. Alcohol comes through in a peppery way. Slight metallic (steely) notes accompany the caramel backing. 		Medium-bodied. 		This is a nicely done, hoppy IPA, even for the style, with a solid caramel backing. Despite slight metallic/steely notes and slight show of the abv, this one disappears "too" quickly and is certainly worth seeking out if you're a follower of the hops! A nice IPA in a can - I'm a happy man!

It tastes like sticky green goodness with just a pinch of grapefruit.		medium bodied, with mellow carbonation that helps tickle the grainy and lemony finish on the roof of the mouth and middle of the tongue.

Pungent hoppy aroma. Tropical fruit, mostly pineapple. Some malt sweetness and light piney touch. Definitely what I expect from a west coast IPA. Some caramel, too.		Good hop flavor. Very pithy. Light sweetness up front, then citrus peel bitterness. Nice hoppy beer without being overwhelmingly bitter.		Medium-light body. Fairly low carbonation level. Smooth, ridiculously easy drinker. Very, very good IPA.

review/text: From a trade with augustgarage. Thanks again!		FWIW, this shit is WAY better than that other canned IPA, Dales Pale Ale.		A- Copper, honeysuckle gold, nice head, good retention and lacing. 		S- Floral hops, grapefruit comes up quickly behind it, very nice. West coast all the way. 		T- Very nice. A good hop bite and a decent malt backbone that provides a bit of caramel sweetness that blends nicely. A bit of spice, grassiness, and some lemon zest round out the floral and citrus hops. 		M- Good carbonation, hops are hoppy (duh) and stick with you for a while. Leaves quite the lasting impression.		D- Sessionable. Tasty. A winner in my book. Another worthy contender in the IPA royal rumble. First place? Nope. But it can hold its own, a damn fine beer.

review/text: Poured from 12oz can. I can not think who sent this too me for the life of me. I need to start putting names with beers I get in! Review from notes.		A- Pours semi-hazy orange/reddish color. One and a half light tan/offwhite head that stays for a little while. Nice soapy lacing hat slides down the glass. 		S- Tropical fruit (pineapple) upfront along with other citrusy hops. Light bready malts in the background. Very light earthy floral hops...these could have been a little more in the aroma in my opinion. 		T- Nice bitter hop bite right off the bat which I didn't foresee. Light malt sweetness in the middle and toward the end. Bitter hop again in the end but not quite as big as in the front. Also a light medical alcohol taste which was a little distracting. 		M- Lighter mouthfeel. Good carbonation for the style. Hops left a trainwreck of bitterness on the palate. Some hop resin stuck around after each sip. Light tropical fruit in the aftertaste. 		D- Very drinkable IPA in my book. The light alcohol taste kind of brought the taste down a half point in my review but after some sips it went away. Nothing is over the top about this IPA and I would easily make this my session beer if it was near me.

I try just about every IPA I can get my hands on: Sculpin, Racer 5, Hop Stoopid are some of my favorites. Big hoppy flavors and amazing fruity smells. You find these in Caldera IPA.		This beer is delicious - if you like good hoppy and flavorful IPAs, give it a try, I bet you'll enjoy it.

review/text: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here.		Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head.		Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not.		There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. 		Decent, but nothing to write home about.

review/text: Poured from can into pint glass...		A: Pours a beautiful golden honey hue with a nice creamy three finger head. Huge head and excellent lacing, falls very slowly in pillows. Very beautiful.		S: Tons of citrus and piney hops. Big aroma, not overly complex, but for an ipa this is very solid. grapefruit and sticky pine hops really jump out with just a hint of caramel malt in the background. Very fresh...		T: Follows the nose perfectly, tons of pine and grapefruit, very crisp and fresh. Faint bready malt in the mid-palate help balance the hops. Faint metallic on the finish, not necessarily in a bad way but just a hint.		M: Medium light body, lots of crisp carbonation dancing on the tongue. Smooth and dry on the finish.		D: So fresh and smooth this one goes down very nice.

review/text: A: A clear amber color with a nice fluffy white head. The lacing on this beer is absolutely incredible.		S: An amazing smell. The smell reminds me of homebrewing. It feels as though I've got a big chunk of fresh Simcoe and Amarillo hops that I'm about to toss into the boil. Very piney and citrusy. Different aromas, but on par with Pliny and Sculpin.		T: The Simcoe train doesn't stop at the nose. Plenty of bitterness and a nice grapefruit flavor as well. Not quite as good as the nose, but almost.		M: This is the one area I think the beer falls a bit short. The body is on the thin/watery side, but the carbonation levels are fine.		D: This is one of my new favorite IPAs. This is a great IPA for just sipping on or drinking during a hot day. I think I'll pick up a six pack the next time I see it.

review/text: A- Stunning clarity, this thing is absolutely defect free, and has a wonderful amber color, with a slightly off white head, suddy lacing and ropes of carbonation.		S- Herbal, lemon grass, piney and a tad of citrus. Has a lot of herbs from far away, even, and it has a very nice balance of all 5 scents. 		T- slightly spicy, malty, but held on because of the hops. This had a little less to it than i thought it would, but its probably because im used to DIPA's. To be fair, it has a remarkable balance to it...i really enjoy this beer, and for something in a "can", which most people are shaky about, i found it impressive.		M- Medium body, nice mixed malty/bitter after finish that is slightly cloying but not offensively. 		D- This stuff is fun to drink. The can is yellow, lively, and fun to look at. I see people looking at this beer all day on the shelf wondering why something in 6 pack cans costs so much. I have an answer for them now! GREAT BEER!

review/text: I first had this beer while in vacation in CA over the past summer. It was so delicious I had to get some more.		A: Pours a clear dark amber color that resembles the color of carrot cake. A nice off white head sits on top that leaves behind some frothy and bubbly lacing.		S: Looooads of grapefruit and pine are right in your face, I think I'd be lying if I said I could smell any of the malt backbone.		T: Loads more of the bitter grapefruit and pine flavors right up front with a sweet citrus flavor that follows. Some mild caramel in the middle, but straight back to the grapefruit and pine at the end. The hop flavor in this beer is INTENSE. Once it warms up a bit you start to get a lot of pineapple and orange as well. This beer just keeps getting better.		M: Dry, well carbonated, light bodied, crisp.		D: This beer is delicious, I wish I could get it here in Boston.

review/text: pour was a deep copper with a slight hazy ruby tint. fluffy cloud like head with decent retention and lacing		huge malts with a slight citrus and floral hop scent. mainly orange and pineapple.		bitter up front, a strong pine bitterness with bits of earthy and citrus bitterness. a bit of white grapefruit, orange, and sweet biscuit malts. 		very full bodied with proper carbonation. the perfect bite to accompany the flavors.		not bad, has a lot of deep bitterness and is a solid IPA. i would prefer some floral flavors but that is just me. the price here would have me thinking twice about getting more but i would have no issues drinking this again.

review/text: A: Yellow and clear. Nice 1 finger white head.	S: Not much here. Slight Cascade hops and malt. I was a bit disappointed at first because the smell was unimpressive. 	T: A nice mix of the C hops. This gives a mouth full of bitter grapefruit and citrus.	M: Very bitter, just like it should be. It is also quite crisp, which makes for a refreshing IPA. No alcohol burn at all.	D: This is an excellent easy drinking IPA. I wish the aroma was a little more hoppy, but overall I enjoyed the brew. I am happy to find this on the shelves at my local craft beer store.

review/text: 12oz can picked up today at the COOP... poured into my Delirium goblet... nice eggshell white head atop a crystal clear lite amber brew.. good lacing.. 		Nose is pretty fresh smelling CCC hops... pale malts and a very minor caramel is way in the background.		Flavor has a fair amount of toasty malts with it.. the hops are mainly in the front with bittering and more in then in the back close toward the finish with some pithy citrus skin... mid-palate is more about the malts.. toasty with minor some lesser caramel.. mouthfeel is a tad heavier than expected.. sorta full with a good carbonation that still leans toward the creamy side of things.		A good IPA that I think is very drinkable, but seems to not find a real identity in the traditional American IPA style.. don't get me wrong, this is a pretty nice beer.. but the maltiness seems a tad high and maybe too pronounced with toastiness and caramel.		3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/4

review/text: Didn't really think much of other Caldera brews I've had, but heard good things about this one and thought it would be worth a try. 		Pours a nice, slightly hazy, toasted ruby-brown color. There's visible carbonation running throughout, feeding a short, well-retained white head. There's a tremendous amount of sticky white lace that marbles the sides of the glass without any signs of fading. 		Smell is all hops - aromas of grapefruit rind and earthy, musky hops come through. There's only the slightest indication of sweetness from the malts. 		Taste definitely reflects the largely hop-forwardness of the aroma. The bitter citrus rind presence in most detectable in the aftertaste, and a hint of the piney, oily sticky hops hits the tongue early on. There is more of a malt foundation in the taste, but it is hardly sweet - more toasty, full and warm. The aftertaste is really nice; it makes me want to wait between sips to enjoy it a little more. Feel is bright and perfectly carbonated - not too much and not too little. It fills the mouth and spreads the flavors around the palate very well.		This is one highly drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink it from the can because you don't see that all that often with crafts. I went for the glass, and enjoyed every last drop. Definitely recommended for a try. It is a solid, everyday IPA.

review/text: Always interested in a can.		Appearance - A deep copper/amber color. Very clear. Half inch of white soapy head. Laces well. 		Smell - Some grapefruit hops, with a touch of pine. Also a little sweet malt. The hops are a little subdued. 		Taste - Follows the smell. There is some nice hops up front, but the malt really comes through at the end. There is a real sweetness, and a little burnt maltiness on the finish. 		Mouthfeel - A little on the thin side. Nice carbonation. 		Drinkability - Pretty decent, it's a nice beer, but nothing special. 		This is a maltier "east coast" style ipa. It's a pretty good beer, but not necessarily my favorite.

review/text: CAN you dig how phenomenal the CANQuest has become? I am trading and/or getting CANs from everywhere! I CAN hardly believe it myself. 		Whoops! I already drank one of my three this morning before even writing anything down. My notes for Ashland Amber included commentary on the CAN itself, including verbiage and mention of CAN-conditioning. This, however, was a visually appealing CAN with vibrant color reproduction and a green pop-tab. My buds at that stoner joint, Roots (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10996/?view=beerfly), would fully dig this CAN. Hey, before anybody gets their panties in a bunch, a) I kid and b) I CAN pass a urinalysis standing on my head. I dig beer, you dig? Plus, that place has a really smoky vibe and I am sure that they would not be particularly offended. Onward.		Both times, my pour has begun with a finger of ecru head which has simply sat down, leaving sticky Belgian lacing in its wake. The nose is forest hops - pine, green, earthy, sticky, massive. Sweet hops the hope of my life - once again, that damned howling monkey shut up and climbed off of my back for the moment. I am on the waiting list for hops rehab but it's a long list and I may not last that long. Thank Bob for hops! 		It now becomes a simple matter of drawing some of this delectable beverage into a syringe through a needle and jamming said needle into one of the few remaining viable veins. No heating necessary. Cold fusion is more satisfactory, anyway. Once I untie my rubber hose, the euphoric quality begins to set in. I am one with the Beeriverse. My existance is justified. I'm not just a simple Hophead. I am a HopJunkie and an unapologetic one, at that. My licking the lacing out of the glass is starting to draw stares from the nieghbors. So what?!? The heck with them! This is my scene, man, and don't mess with me while I'm digging it. Find your own scene and report back. 		Man, how do I convey veinfeel over mouthfeel? It was righteous! Full, sticky, veinous (not vinous), right on, baby! Finish was hoppy, sticky, yummy, the EMTs are trying to restart my heart, man. Zounds!		Where am I? Was this a review? Wow, man. What a groovy trip. Did you dig the scene too, or was it just me? I gotta get in the shower, man. I'll try anything once.

T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, nice malt finish.		M - Nice IPA medium body with a average carbonation. Smooth feel.		D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had so far. I am sure it will be great this coming summer on a canoe trip. Like the can, easy to carry.

review/text: Poured into a standard pint glass at about 40-45 degrees.		Shows an orange-like copper in the pint with a nice white froth. Citrus and pine hops jump out of the glass with orange, lime, dried apricot, subtle peach (I know...it's weird, but that's what I got), pine, and easy hop leaves followed by a clear caramel, biscuit, and a touch of cereal grains. On the palate, there is a medium hop bitterness that shows fron the beginning through the finish that is smooth, but a little lean and kind of weak for an IPA. Although the beer is very smooth, balanced, and easy to drink, I was looking for more of a hop presence from this beer (being that's it's a west coast style IPA). Overall, it's a solid IPA that is very easy to drink, but one that left me looking for more.

review/text: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.

review/text: A: A light orange gold, with modest tightly knit bit of head that stays.		S: Nice piney, grapefruit and citrus, hint of biscuity malts		T: First flavors are a strong, piney, grapefruit bite, with a tad of crystalish malts barely balancing it out, then a bitter finish of resinous west coast hops.		M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops.		D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's. Still a very delicious west coast IPA well worth the try. Just probably wouldn't make this session beer.

review/text: Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. Beer is orange and clear. Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium.		Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive.		Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA.

review/text: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing.		S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end		T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped.		M - Crisp IPA light/medium body with medium carbonation.		D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA.		Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.

review/text: Can from K&L Redwood City.		A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing.		S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits.		T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course.		M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation.		D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.

review/text: Can from Brickskeller in Washington DC.		Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing.		Smells of large citrus and leafy hop aromas with light amounts of pale and caramel malts.		Tastes similar to how it smells. A combination of pale and caramel malt flavors up front are soon overtaken by bright citrus hop and earthy leafy hop flavors. Near the end of the sip the malt flavors take over and have a grainy quality before giving way to a solidly bitter and crisp ending.		Mouthfeel is good. It has a solid thickness with moderate carbonation.		Drinkability is very good. I finished the can quickly and could easily have a few more.		Overall I'd been looking forward to trying this IPA for a while and it didn't disappoint. Well worth a shot.

review/text: Appearance - This is a shiny bronze in color with a modest head that showed good retention and left some nice lattice work on the inside of my glass.		Smell - The hops are deep, rich, and complex here and quickly surpass the good malty base of this ale. There's a beautiful orange citrus here that isn't too sweet but more like the aroma of a fine orange liqueur. The stiff pine gives a contrasting compliment to the citrus and a bit of lemongrass to complete the puzzle.		Taste - The big malt base, almost like a DIPA, comes on much stronger at the taste and is amazingly able to hold its own against these huge, complex hops. The pine from the nose steps back a bit on the tongue but otherwise this ale tastes like it smells.		Mouthfeel - This is a solid medium-bodied with some large bitterness that is tempered by the light toffee sweetness of the malts. The carbonation is rightly light and overall this IPA has a terrific mouthfeel.		Drinkability - This is a big, complex IPA that seems like a double until you notice that the ABV is just slightly over 6%.

S-Sharp spicy citrus and pine hop aroma with a bit of apricot. Backed up with light sweet biscuit malt.		T-Spicy citrus hops with other tropical fruit notes. More assertive peppery bite lying on top of a nice bed of sweet biscuit malt. 		M-Medium-light bodied, sharp and crisp with nice lingering spicy hop bite. 		D-A hop forward, every day drinking IPA that has plenty of flavour to make you happy. Good job, could use a touch more citrus----&gt;or maybe I need a fresher can? Will certainly visit again.

review/text: PREMISE: I have been considering moving to Oregon, and this IPA may very well have put me over the edge. 		A - I was happy to see a real nice amber color to this beer as I poured it from the can into the glass I had just retrieved from the freezer. The only other canned beer I have tried recently that I can recommend is Dales Pale Ale. Many people cannot believe that a decent beer can come from a can. For the most part, I agree. This, as with Dales, is an exception. Knowing a decent canned beer is valued quintessentially to those of us who enjoy the back-country experience and like to pack out what we pack in. There is something special about being able to stick a couple of really good ales or IPA's in the snow on a telemarking trek and enjoy that beverage in the raw and untamed wild. I have had a few such occasions in the beautiful Arapahoe Nat. Forest of Summit County, CO. 		This ale poures into a chilled glass easily with a two to three finger, full, creamy head and leaves a sweet lacing on the glass, all the way to the last sip. The well carbonated ale continues to offer a flow of small bubbles consistently as it stands in the glass. As for the appearance, I have to say that I also am quite fond of the labeling. Anyone collecting cans should have a Caldera IPA in the line-up.		S - The smell of this beer is what you want folks who think beer stinks to sample. I could imagine Caldera IPA incense, the smell is so natural and becoming. I used to appreciate deeply the aroma of the pines and aspens as I guided horseback tours in the Colorado Divide, and this is what Caldera reminds me of. 		T - Caldera IPA tastes delicious. I love hoppy beers and this satisfies while I would say it won't scare off those who like a hoppy beer but are somewhat easily offended. It has a nice bitterness that says a solid hello from the tip of the tongue around both sides, but doesn't try to rip apart your mucous membranes with the vigor and skill of pissed off Norseman. The flavor is complex, sensuous and mystifying. The finish is crisp and clean and as I am experiencing at this very moment, one simply is not enough. My glass is in the freezer right now getting prepped for a second round. 		M - This IPA has a full bodied, smooth and delightful feel that is welcome on the palate, to be savored and swallowed slowly, eyes closed and head tilted slightly aft, slowly exhaling through the nose to extract the many intricacies that the craftsmen at Caldera have steeped into this marvelous 12 ounce can. 		D - At 6.1%, this IPA is very, very drinkable. Beware, if you are not on foot and close to home while enjoying Caldera IPA - it can sneak up on you. Filling? Not terribly for such a well built and hardy concoction. 		THE FINAL ANALYSIS: If you enjoy drinking beer, you must try Caldera IPA - especially if you like to drink out of bounds.

review/text: I had this at Arena's Cafe in Rehoboth Beach, DE. Poured from the chilled can into a pint glass. 		A - A medium copper-like peach tea shade w/ a proud 3 fingers of cream, rocky headed w/ very fine bead and good lacing. 		S - A crisp, tropical hop odor w/ a pine and pineapple(orange according to octopus87)aroma w/ hints of light apricot and grapefruit in the nose w/ mild pepper. 		M - A crisp, juicy and mild sweet feel w/ a moderate carbonation level. Medium bitterness and slight spiciness w/ a resinous accent and residual bitterness in the finish		T - The taste is smooth w/ a spiced hop flavor that is fruity w/ hints of pineapple, mango and orange zest. There is a malt backbone that anchors the flavor w/ mild grain and sweetness in the taste. There are flavors that remind of peach w/ a slight spicy pepper mellow flavor. The beer creates nice hop burps as I near the end of the glass which can only mean I was refreshed by the taste.		D - I found this to be a very drinkable ale, a fine IPA w/ out any 'hop assault', but hoppy enough to satisfy your average hop fan. Still bitter flavored and refreshing -an almost "must try" IMO.

review/text: Suprised by the hoppy taste from this can. 	Consumed at a bar called the Tin Can in St. Louis. 		Citrus notes in the initial smell gives way to a hoppy and well carbonated first drink. I also pick up a little banana aroma. 		I drank this brew straight from the can which probably didn't assist the experience but it us definitely a drinkable ipa. As previously stated it is quite hoppy for a can which is refreshing. 		I am not able to get this at home so I am glad that I tried it.

review/text: Served from a Trippy Graphic Yellow Can into a Sam Adams glass. No brewed on date. Purple ring around the top points out all the advantages cans have over glass for outdoor activity.		A - Medium copper, clear, not much carbonation present, head was small and disappears rather quickly. 		S - Pale bready malt, citric hops. Not overpowering, but definitely there. 		T - Citric hops beat out the malt from the get go. If you are a hop head, you will like this for just a "regular" IPA. Bitter in a good way.		MF - Light to medium bodied. Crisp. Dry. Very nice.		D - $8.99 per six'r = $1.50 per 12oz. Cans a 0.5 adder too. So very drinkable given the price, medium body, and can.		Overall - This is a great IPA can or not. Can doesn't give any residual metalic taste that I can pick up (when drinking from a glass). I will take this over a pour into a red plastic cup at the beach (I will test that theory tomorrow!)		Good one. Got to try others from Caldera.

review/text: a - pours a deep burnt orange color, two-finger off-white head with very good retention and lacing, almost perfectly clear		s - big amounts of lemony and tangerine citrus notes mixed with bready/grainy aromas		t - very well-balanced, much like the smell, lots of lemon and other citrus on the palate with a substantial amount of graininess for a backbone, pretty strong lasting bitterness on the finish		m - medium-bodied, moderate to high carbonation, very dry on the finish		d - the dryness of the finish is somewhat hard on the palate, but nothing that would limit a hophead, the real hit to drinkability comes from the lack of depth in flavor, this isn't a bad beer, just not all that interesting

review/text: No Canned on Date		A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head.		S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin.		T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter.		M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA.		D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.

review/text: 12 oz. can, 		A: Pours amber, nice finger sized white head, good head retention, solid lace, nice look all around.		S: Oranges/Simcoe, tropical fruit, pine, a very pretty smell, but understated, could be great.		T: Heavy citrus dominates - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pine in the finish. Like the Pale, the malt is very light, I like the hop profile a lot more in this one as compared to the Pale.		M: Soft carbonation - perhaps from the can, medium-bodied.		D: Pretty standard Northwest IPA, a fine drinking beer, not going to wow you.

review/text: Pours a slightly hazy copper color with about one and a half fingers of creamy, white colored, head that has great retention. Aroma is of caramel, grapefruit, herbal hops, and toasted grain.		This is a very hoppy beer. Lots of citrus and pine are present. A touch of caramel is in the background. There is a sharp lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied and an easy drinker. A very nice IPA and its made even nice by the fact it comes in a can. Perfect for a round of golf or other outside activities.

review/text: Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. can. Pours clear and deep golden/copper in color and offers a nice bubbly half inch of off white head. This settles to a surface cap in a minute or two but doesn't hold up to offer any lacing with the carbonation heading for the hills by half glass.		Nice blend of hops on the nose with some orange citrus and fresh cut pine, with a certain resiny quality in that regard. Hops are quite light and become a bit more elusive over time. Some clean fruity malt notes accompany. Good quality but not quantity.		Smooth in flavor and light in body as predicted from the nose. Finishes with a distinct and lingering orange flavor and just a hint of bitterness follows. Decent unobtrusive feel and drink.		This is an IPA 'Lite' for me. Light hops and malts, well balanced yes, but very light bodied for the style. Would have dubbed this an APA. Wonder what their Pale is like?

Creamy head with orange tinges poured quite thick then faded quickly to light ring around the edge. Light carbonation... light lacing lines...

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into pint glass. No dating.		Pours light amber or transparent copper with a one and a half finger white head. Plenty of bubbles rising to the top. Good retention and good lacing.		Aroma is of floral and earthy hops, candied oranges, and fruit juice. Tastes of grassy and piney hops with a touch of orange rind. Malt sweetness adds some balance, but not a lot. West Coast in terms of bitterness, but not a lot of aromatic or fruity hops. Finish has lots of bitter floralness. Medium bodied and sticky with full carbonation.		Very similar to the pale ale, but with more hopping and more malts. I thought initially this was better, but then realized I would rather have less of this flavor since I don't particularly enjoy it. Not enough malt to be "balanced" but not floral or fruity enough to be a tasty San Diego style either. So-so.

review/text: I was torn on this one. Drink it from the can, as it was meant to be drank, or pour into a glass. Well, I went with a glass. Old habits die hard....		Pours a golden copper color with half an inch of off-white head. Nice lacing clings to the glass.		The aroma, even after it warms, doesn't give me anything but grapefruit and tangerine hops. The scent, while very nice for an IPA, just seems muted. I guess I just want it more in my face and not so much like a sachet of hops thrown in a drawer. Make sense?		The flavor is more in my face...and I like it! I wish I could give this one a 4.25 cuz that is where I feel it belongs. Nice and bitter hops come out in a wide range of citrus flavors. It's pretty damn bitter, but that is why I like it. A bit earthy at the end. Also had a taste of powdered aspirin right at the finish. The finish keeps it from getting to that 4.5 for me.		Medium bodied. Average carbonation. Bitter, drying aftertaste screams for you to take another sip and I'll gladly oblige. Another canned beer worthy of any tailgating, camping, golfing, outdoor event of your choosing where bottles are frowned upon. I think I found another can to sit along side Dale's and Gordon in the beer fridge.

review/text: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.

review/text: 12 ounce can poure into a snifter. Purchased from Bear Creek Beers in Medford, OR for $1.65. Comes in at 6.1%. No bottling info is given.		A-Pours a fairly clear amber with orange and peach highlights. Has a 3/4 finger off white head that fades fast into a small filmy patch.		S-It is a tad weak in the nose. It almost seems like it was not dry hopped. It reminds me more of bittering hops. There is some grapefruit and pine as well as some biscuit malt and some caramel malt.		T-The first part of each sip is pretty good. There is a bracing level of grapefruit bitterness that hits fast. It is definitely earthy/herbal tasting with a tad bit of malt sweetness in the middle. It finishes with some medicinal flavor and leaves an aspirin aftertaste. It also feels a little roasty.		M-It is thinner bodied and the carbonation is fine. It has a roasty and dry aftertaste.		D-The medicinal/aspirin taste is not my thing.		It is hard to tell if this is how it is supposed to taste based on the fact that there is no bottling info on the can. I would only try this again if I knew it was fresh.

review/text: A: Pours a hazy orange/reddish with a soapy, foamy head. Lots of bubbles of small carbonation.		S: Pine, citrus, and grapefruit all the way, almost to the point of smelling like a Fresca! (how's that for an obscure reference). The malt is also noticeable in the form of a little fruitness.		T: Wow! The hops pack a whallop both in the nose and in the finish of the taste, but the sweet malt coats the tongue and the throat and balances out nicely. The aftertaste of so many hops does take down the mouthfeel a bit, but the taste is definitely...tasty!!!		M: The hops sting a bit, even in the mouthfeel, but the malt is moderately thick, which helps wash everything down. The only drawback I can see is that the hops stick around so much in the aftertaste. It wants me to drink more, but it still is a little surprising.		D: This is a good IPA. Almost like a Firestone Pale Ale supercharged; the hops are front and center, and the malt does its job to try and balance it, but the overall impression is HOPS. I like this, and like the idea of cans, but this is NOT for folks who don't like it bitter!!

T- Wow this stuff is great! the pine taste and citrus just explode in your mouth at the first drink.		Unfortunately only one store carries this in my area and it is a bit of a trip but well worth it for one of the best beers out of a can you ever had.

review/text: The hops-adorned label just called to me...and it's in a can, which I fully support. So it pours into the glass a lovely toasty bronze-rust color, with a crazy-fluffy head that looks like the top of a root-beer float. Lasts a long while too.		Nose is ultra-hoppy...very much veering into the fresh fabric-softener breeziness area. Not much else behind it, but gotta love it.		Flavor is delightful hoppiness all the way. Bright, breezy, a bit intense but not overwhelming. The malts carefully and successfully offer backup, or maybe more of a foundation than anything, as the prickly, colorful hops continue to be the magical ingredient with each sip. A little green, a little leafy, and very, very nice unless you're not into hops. A slight twist of graininess that reminds of rye carries through, especially into the finish. Also some candy-like sweetness, especially with a little warming.		Mouthfeel is neither here nor there. Not much to say about it, but it's fine. It's a medium-bodied beer with some prickly carbonation and a bit of stickiness.		A very solid IPA, and a very drinkable west-coast version of the style. It's not over-the-top while still exuding the character of its region, and the ABV makes it completely manageable if you're wanting several in a row.

review/text: Poured Cooper colored with withe 3 finger head. 	S= sweet Carmel, citrus, piney, with nice hop aroma. 	T=sweet Carmel, with big hop flavor and nice hop bite, sweet finsih with a long lingering bitterness, but not an overpower kind of bitter, it's pretty tame, it just there. Also some grapefruit flavor in there as well.	M=nice big full body, maybe even a little too much for an IPA, but I like it personally.		Overall, great IPA in my opinion, easily one of the top 5 IPAs that we get I'n the state, although, I'm not sure I'd that's exactly a complent to he beer, or a knock on my state....at any rate, I will be buying this like nobody business.

review/text: Purchased a six-pack at BevMo! Cypress.		A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear light-copper color with a sticky head of foam that reduces to a thin layer over the beer. Each sip leaves some web-like lacing along the inside of the glass. 		S- Piney, oily hop aromas with a malt backing that has a slight element of fruity sweetness but mostly smells of rich crakerish grain. There's a corse, almost metallic note to the smell, much like most of Sierra Nevada's beers. In fact, Caldera's IPA smells very much like a Sierra Nevada beer. Celebration Ale comes to mind. 		T- Lots of bitter grapefruit flavor. Grainy, bready malts provide minimal balance. Pithy flavors of melon rind lead the way to a dry finish that leaves a hoppy and slightly metallic bitterness lingering on the palate. 		M- The mouthfeel is very full-bodied with some nice fizzy carbonation that complements the thick and somewhat oily texture.		D- The 6.1% ABV makes it easy to have a few of these in a row, but I would have liked a little more fruity sweetness in the flavor to balance out the big bitterness.		A very tasty IPA. Bring on the canned beers!

S: Sharp citrus and pineapple hop aroma. A tiny bit of hop astringency. Characteristic hop sweetness is appealing. 	T: The same sweet and sharp hop flavors are found here. Very similar to HotD Blue Dot. Almost a piney flavor.	M: Smooth and a tad away from creamy. Very delicious flavors last on your palate.	D: Great beer. I would love to open up a few cans of this brew on a hot day. I'll have to grab a few more. Wish it was readily available here.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. Single purchased at local health food store for $1.49. My first craft beer from a can.		A-Clear amber-orange with 1 1/2 finger, off-white head with average retention and moderate lacing. Very pleasing appearance.		S-Piney hops with some citrus aroma present. Very inviting.		T-Somewhat disappointing since the flavor does not match well with expected smell and is dominated by earthy bitterness that is ultimately unbalanced. I couldn't discern any malt backbone. Very bitter, persistent after taste. Not very pleasant. Unsure about freshness, but this has not been a concern from the seller/distributors. I like hoppy IPAs, but prefer balance too. Balance was absent.		M-Begins well but ends up being harsh because of the after taste. Low to medium carbonation gives is it a smoothness that is unfortunately emasculated by the bitterness. 		D-An average West Coast IPA. Okay, but I won't buy again. The bitter aftertaste nearly gave me heartburn.		If offered one to drink I would drink it but only after concluding nothing better is available. A bit pricey compared to better Oregon brewed IPAs. I bought this today because I wanted to try some different IPAs on hot day in the Willamette Valley. Overall, I was nonplussed.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a clear pint glass. No freshness date. SIngle purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $2.15.		A: Clear amber-orange with 1-2 finger, off-white head with average retention but lots of lacing.		S: Complex and sumptuous aromas of pine, citrus, sweet caramel and pale malt, tropical fruit, and leaf all come through to present a most appetizing brew.		T: the flavor does not deliver fully on the promising smell and it is dominated by earthy, leafy bitterness that leaves all complexity behind. The malt flavors peek through to a minor extent with some balancing sweetness. This is a great beer for hopsheads who like pure raw bitterness hitting them in the mouth.		M: Pretty slick and coating with low-medium carbonation and a spicy-bitter aftertaste.		D: A not bad, not great IPA that won't win any awards for value. It will win for rawness and unrestrained bitterness, which, even though I like hoppy IPAs, is not my favorite combination.

This is followed up by a nive tropical fruit hop flavor, pineapple, papaya and mango. The finish is a long bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit zest with a touch of pith.		Medium body, nice carbonation, tingly and slightly creamy at the same time.		I could drink several of these. It is a very fine IPA.		Thanks For Reading

review/text: This beer struck me as a very malt-forward IPA; lots of caramel was evident from start to finish in both its aroma and flavor. Even it's color, in a different sense, could be described as caramel. It was a pretty good beer, but I prefer my IPAs to be a little more hop dominant, and a little less malty. I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was anything to write home about.		Color was a dark rich amber color, with a good amount of head. Aroma was malt first, with lots of caramel notes and some hoppiness. Flavor was exceedingly balanced, more like an amber ale than an IPA, with the hops just barely peeking out from behind more caramel flavor. Mouthfeel was light, crisp, and pleasant. Quite a satisfying beer, but it didn't really scratch my itch for hops.		A huge thank you to JaBier for gifting me a can of this beer; otherwise I probably never would have tried it.

review/text: Lots of hop aroma. Mostly citrus but I get some woody variety too. There's a caramel malt underneath with a hint of esters but it's pretty much hops.		Nice orange color and very clear. Started out with a big off-white head that fades immediately to a little layer of wispy foam over the top of my glass.		Very pleasant right off. It started out very bitter with citrus hop oils but there's a solid caramel malt flavor that fights through. Each sip has a great bitter/sweet interplay of hops and malt. I get a hint of roast malt in the aftertaste but then there's a lingering hop bitterness. 		Nice full body with a creamy carbonation level.		Good stuff in a can. A nice well balanced IPA.

review/text: Pours out a clear, amber/orange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing.	The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates.	Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness.	Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later.	Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.

review/text: 12 oz can, poured into a tulip.		Body is a bright see-thru amber orange with a finger of pretty fluffy off-white head. Visible stream of constant carbonation up the middle of the tulip. Retention and lacing are good		Smells tasty. Fresh squeezed OJ and grapefruit juice up front with pine in the background. Some caramel maltiness, but not enough to obscure the hops.		Really nice flavor profile. The fresh orange and grapefruity from the nose carries over and is joined by a bit of pineapple. The sweet malt backbone is fairly substantial up front, yet there's a toasty element to it as well. Steadily dries out, and pine creeps back in for a puckery and spicy finish. 		Nice juicy mouthfeel. Medium yet fluffy body, moderate carbonation.		Overall impression: Excellent brew, another winner from Caldera.

review/text: Pours a clear orange with a big tan head. Smells of citrus. Taste is very citrusy up front, with a nice caramel malt middle, and an herbal, smoky hop finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is great, several of these in a row wouldnt be difficult. A super choice for an IPA which conveniently comes in a can.

review/text: Pours clear copper with a robust head and moderate lacing. The aroma is strong, immediately apparent from several feet away - malty and fairly conventional IPA aroma, perhaps a bit of Amarillo hops or something similar. The flavor is pleasant and grainy, with a sharp hop bitterness and a nutty, toasty edge. Again, this seems seems strongly suggestive of Amarillo, with a sharp orangy character, particularly of the bitterness, which seems like that dry, bitter character from Orange zest. The mouthfeel is smooth and clingy, leaving that citric bitterness firmly planted on teh tongue.		A good beer.

review/text: A - Big rocky batter like light tan head... Rich caramel color... Faint traces of slow to moderate paced carbonation... Loads of stickiness on the sides of the glass... 		S - Full and rich piney hop aroma up front... Sweet caramel and butter toffee... Quite inviting....		T - The hops are upfront and potent, but far from over powering... Mostly piney with trace amounts of grapefuit and sweet citrus... A dense malt backbone permeates throughout... Caramel... Toffee... Biscuit... A tad of honey... 		M - Medium bodied and fluffy... A lush creaminess... Just the slightest bit of carbonation on the tongue... A faint bitterness lingers throughout... 		D - Terrifically complexities and flavor, especially for the 6.1% ABV... A very underrated IPA...

review/text: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance.		S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA.		T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery.		M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either.		D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs.		Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.

review/text: A - Clear, bright orangish-brown in color. Thick, foamy off-white head. Good retention and excellent lacing. Very active carbonation bubbles quickly rising to the top.		S - Strong, citrusy hop aroma domainates the nose. The malts do provide ample balance with a very bready and caramel laced sweetness. Primarily grapefruit with just a hint of tangerine in the nose.		T - Strong citrusy bitterness right off with lots of grapefruit especially. There is a strong sweetness as well mid-drink with a big caramel taste. Some candied fruit notes come in late before the drink finishes with a dominan citrusy bitterness. Another well crafted IPA from Oregon.		M/D - Medium bodied, a little sticky. Bitterness sticks with you long after the beer is gone. Good carbonation.

review/text: A huge thanks goes out to the awesome BA from the NW who sent me this as a kick ass extra. I had been wanting to try this for a while now. Served cold and poured into a pint glass, this one was consumed on 06/26/2009.		The pour was very nice. Deep amber in color with a nice clarity to it. A big head of white coming up and over the top and settling down with a good amount of side glass lacing. Big aroma of fresh hops on this one. Just a huge nose of grapefruit, pineapple and hints of orange peel. Deep and resionous, almost sticky just in the aroma. As the first sip hits, not as sharp and pungent as the aroma, but seriously this was a good IPA. Nice and tight with the fresh hops letting your lips stick to your teeth. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit leading the way but fading into a nice mid palate of buttery malts. Nice medium feel and an easy, very smooth sessionability.		Overall this was excellent. A very easy to drink, very nice and very hoppy west coast IPA. I would go for this one again any day!

review/text: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie!		Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!

review/text: Chilled can into a glass. An extra courtesy of bvc. Thanks!		A: Pours a clear amber body with active carbonation up the glass. Has an inch off-white head with good retention, and it leaves some spots of lacing down the glass. 		S: Citrus and pine hops, with a slight resiny and earthy/dirt/grass undercurrent to it that is a bit of a turnoff. 		T: As the nose suggests, the taste is dominated by citrus hops, with pine coming second. Caramel malt fleshes out the mid-taste, but toward the end, an earthy and grassy blend takes over and pulls throught into the aftertaste. There is a lingering resiny bitterness as a result. 		M: Sticky, with bitter resin coating the mouth. Sometimes I like this, but here it's too grassy and earthy to enjoy. 		D: I really wanted to try this, and I'm glad I did -- because I'm satisfied that I don't need to have it again. It's apparently pretty pricey, and there's nothing in here that justifies that to me.

review/text: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.

review/text: Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.

review/text: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug:	A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass.	S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty.	T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. 	M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character.	D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.

review/text: Pours a clear amber color with a half inch, slightly off white head sitting on top. Good retention, and some spotty lace is present.		The aroma is pretty good. There's a nice hop presence which gives a really good dose of citrus. I don't have much else to say about it, but the nose is very pleasant.		The taste is decent. A nice hop presence gives a decent dose of citrus. There's a very nice bitterness on the finish. It is a pretty balanced IPA IMO. I get a good malt presence, kind of a raw grain feel. I think they use a very similar malt bill in their amber and pale. 		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated with a very fine bubble. 		Drinkability is pretty high. The alcohol is easily managed and well incorporated into the beer. The flavor profile is pleasing as well making for an enjoyable experience.

review/text: A: Pours a dark golden orange with subtle amber tinting. Head is a huge off white bubble of fluff. Even with a careful pour the head rose up with a mighty fury. Retention is strong and the lacing coats around the glass. This is a great looking beer. 		S: Crisp with pine and lemon citrus hops. This is pure bitter hops with no real malt aromas to be found. Grapefruit and peppered orange slush. Spiced apples and limes. Hints of fresh herb and cannabis.		T: This is a juicy lemon crisp beer with black pepper finish. Solid hops taste that is strong but not overwhelming. Much like the nose this is crisp and refreshing tasting. Slight buttery malt backdrop but overall this is all about the hops. Leaves a strong bitter aftertaste that goes perfect with some spiced foods. 		M: Juicy with perfect carbonation. Sticks all around the mouth.		D: Since I have been in a can craft beer zone recently this psychedelic yellow six pack caught my attention. These drink quickly and easily. A little pricey at $10.99 a six but it ended up being a pretty good investment. Very impressive IPA. New Valis album goes well with a number of these.

review/text: From 12oz can to Bruges hybrid glass on 11/20/11	*From notes		A: A lovely darker shade of amber-orange. A good pour yields a two finger head and decent lacing. From the looks of things, this is filtered.		S: Resinous, a bit dank and fruity.		T: Piney, yet there's some tropical fruit which kicks around the walls of my mouth. Golden toasted grains and some earthiness wrap things up.		M: Extremely creamy. It really feels luscious.		O: Caldera's IPA is yet another solid entry into one of my favorite styles. It ain't at the top of a prestigious list, but it's certainly one I've got qualms quaffing. This is one I've reached for before, and will again. If you see (fresh) cans of this, do yourself a favor and check it out.

review/text: Got this as an extra from Rhettroactive. Thanks buddy!		A- Pours nice deep golden shade. Bubbly white head, clings to the edge of the glass with bits of lace sticking.		S- Big burst of orange and mango aromas. Tough to even pick anything out over the great smells coming from it. A little sweet malt at the end. 		T- Not what I was expecting after the nose. Some citrus hop flavors up front but very subdued. Sweet malts quickly take over and mix into a sweet almost tangy taste. Where did all the juicy hop flavors I thought were coming go to?		M- Lighter side of medium body. Little carbonation. Very mild bitterness. Kind of metallic after taste.		O- It started off so great. Fizzled out with the mediocre taste. Was really wanting big juicy hop flavors, but just weren't there. Thanks for the try Rhett!!

review/text: Thanks to robbrandes got this extra. Poured into tulip glass...		A- Dark for an IPA. Bronze/copper color with a rocky pale cream head. Sticky lacing remains on the glass and is slowly revealed as the head sinks into the beer.		S- Citrus forward. Lemons and limes, fruit Smarties, and grapefruit. Aroma is a little lighter than I remember, and not much malt behind the hops in nose.		T/M- A slight chalkiness upfront on the flavor before the citrus comes through. Grapefruit and grapes pop prominently. Bitterness is all on the finish, with a nice moderate IBU level that could be about 10-15 higher per my preference. Alcohol announces it's presence, but not over powering. Body is medium, leaning towards heavy. Carbonation is fairly low, leaving this slick and borderline slimy in the mouth.		O- I like this beer now, but I love it when I get it at the bar and don't analyze it as much. Has solid properties, but nothing that makes it stand out against other competitors. Above average, but it gets pushed aside at it's price when Sweetwater, Yazoo, and others are on the same shelf...

Citrus hops, and a hint of caramel...		T - Caramel up front followed by grapefruit, and a hint of orange. Finishes with a smooth hop bitterness. Abv is well hidden...		M - Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Super smooth...		O - This one isn't overly complex, or a hop bomb, but it is a smooth well balanced brew.

review/text: Pours a hazy orangish amber with 1/4" of dense, foamy, white head that has great retention. The nose has notes of bready malt, pineapple, and grapefruit with a faint flora aroma. The taste is bready and malty up front with a nice blend of hop characters ranging from pineapple, grapefruit-citrus, and faint pine. The flavors are very well blended. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and very refreshing.		This is delicious and very easily drinkable. I could put away a lot of these especially since the bitterness from the hops isn't overpowering like in some IPAs so no diminishing returns here.

Ruby red grapefruit, pine resin and floral hops on top of a sweet caramel malt bed. Slightly more hop forward than malt forward on the nose.		A little bit more of a balance here. It's like east coast meets west coast in one can. Big grapefruit and pine with sturdy caramel holding down the back end.		Sticky and resiny on the feel, medium body with good carbonation.

review/text: Picked this one up at the Beer Dispensary in Apex, NC - only place in this area that sells it. Poured into a 0.5L Ayinger glass ("Echte Bierkultur Geniessen") from a 12oz. can. Had a sip of this one golfing and had to give it a proper review.	A - nice, slightly hazy dark orange/amber color. A nice rocky head forms off the pour and a thin layer clings to the glass and hangs around all the way down.	S - Nice hoppy nose off this one, with some maltiness mixed in.	T - Funny how your brain needs to adjust when drinking out of a can; first sip of this was during a round of golf, right out of the can and my first thought was, "wow, this is GOOD beer" because you're expecting something thin and watered down. A "proper" tasting confirms my first sip; poured into a glass, this is a damn good, drinkable IPA. Nice hint of sweetness up front which is quickly run over by a nice rindy, bittery-y flavor which hangs around on the tongue for quite a while between sips. 	M - This drinks pretty smooth; carbonation is pretty low but the bitterness hangs around for a while (in a good way). 	Damn solid IPA; highly recommend grabbing it if you spot it somewhere (especially you East Coasters).

review/text: Slightly hazed orange-amber with a towering head of persistent, lumpy foam. Sugary citrus zestiness, green pine, and a crackery/doughy note in the nose. Very smooth hoppy flavor. It doesn't smack you in the face with any sort of brashness, just lovely fresh hops...orange and pine (definitely some Simcoe in there) with a gradualy increasing bitterness that tends to stick to the inside of the mouth. Not particularly "bright", it leans more towards the dark and dank side with just the right amount of malty sweetness and a touch of honey. Medium bodied, oily, and bitter. Very nice!

review/text: 12 oz can poured into a goblet - fridge - 2009		Appearance: Pours a golden orange color with well, orange highlights .The head soars to 3" and has an ivory hue to it. It shows great retention and tons of foamy lace gets left behind on the glass. Tons.		Smell: Piney and citrusy hops are strong. It smells like Centennial or nugget hops. It's hard to discern the malts that are lying behind the hops. Very fresh, especially from a can. No metal aromas!		Taste: King of mineral and earthy, doesn't really live up to the aroma. Still quite tasty though.		Mouthfeel: Bitter, earthy, yeasty and a little boozy. Lingering bitterness.		Drinkability: A good IPA. Not good, but very drinkable and worthy of a sample. I would revisit.

review/text: Pours a nice orange/copper/goldish-amber with a finger or two of creamy head into a tumbler.		Lively aromas of citrus and pine with a bit of toast and caramel coming through.		Well balanced, juicy, sweet middle with a dry finish. A west coast by way of the east coast IPA. Caramel and toasted notes balancing resiny hop flavors... but the bulk of the flavor is hop.		Creamy with a nice lift to it.		One of those IPAs that always seems greater than the sum of its parts. Everything is good, but it's not a true hop explosion that really gets me excited. On the other hand, this is a truly drinkable and enjoyable IPA. If this were my local, I'd have a sixer of this around a lot of the time.		Thanks, Wackyfoot.

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into a pint glass.		Pours a bright, crisp orange-tinted amber. Huge (two to three finger) rocky, foamy, off-white head that's taking it's time diminishing.		Nose is a pleasant balance of citrus and pine, both sweet and earthy at once. The hops are clear, but frankly are less enticing that it seems they ought to be. Nothing about how this beer smells turns me away, but there's not much to really draw me in.		Caldera IPA is surprisingly mild on first sip, with the pine and citrus hop balance eventually coming through. Relatively subtle but clear bitterness complements the beer without overtaking it. Pleasant lingering mild bitterness in the finish, with an overall sense of earthiness.		Light to medium bodied, leaning toward light. Slight drying effect makes me want another sip. A solid, drinkable beer, and the light body actually boosts the drinkability rating. Still, for $14.99 a six-pack I'll gladly stick with something else. This is a good IPA, but not good enough to command such a price.

review/text: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.

review/text: A 12 oz can from Liquid Solutions.		A: The IPA is a full amber color, a mixture of brown and yellow that results in an dull orange hue. A luxurious head of nearly two fingers has laced in spades.		S: The aroma is strong, even fresh out of the can. Thick grapefruit and pine notes battle to attention. An odd malt aroma, very vegetal and regurgitated. It tempers the beauty of the hops.		T: This is an IPA that fires on all cylinders. The hops are fresh, loaded with citrus and pine flavor. The bitterness is fairly low but it is there, lingering below the surface. The caramel grains stand out, pairing nicely with the hops.		M: The IPA really hits the spot with a large hop profile that bites as it soothes. A good beer that screams West coast IPA.		D: A very quaffable ale that doesn't skimp on the hops. Too bad the nose was a little offputting.

review/text: one word WOW! this has to be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, the hop profile is well preseved inside its 12 oz can.		Pours a warm copper color with a huge floral aroma of hops. I would say the freshness of the hops makes it almost over hopped and hard to drink. But, it is a must for any hop head to try.		Not your average canned beer...try one you love it or hate it...

review/text: Poured from a 12 oz can into my Lazy Magnolia glass.		Pours a hazy amber with golden tones on the side of the glass. A nice billowy, two-finger head forms,(and sticks around) possibly the result of a forced hard-pour from the can.		A big dose of piney, earthy hops hits hard up front in the nose. The resiny qualities of the aroma subside after a bit, and a sweet malt backbone comes through towards the end. 		Up front, this beer has a very bitter, resiny hop thwack, as much as several "DIPA's" I've had. There's also a fruitiness from the hops that complements the sweet malt backbone very well, as well as helping this be a very balanced beer. Moderate carbonation makes this medium-light on the palate and refreshing.		Solid West Coast IPA, and probably the coolest looking can on the market.

Very nice flavor. Slightly roasted dry finish with just a twinge of fruitiness. Excellent bitters all the way through. Slightly thin feel, though.		Overall, very nice.

review/text: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn/amber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace.		S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel.		T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too.		M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer.		D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.

review/text: As far as the look goes on this one, it looks kinda copper as I stare down into the can. Its a caldera baby, celebrate the can and drink from it.		This is a nice smelling ipa, moderate amount of pine, and citrus. Smells like cascade hops.		As far as taste its not scrape your tongue hoppy, but it is definitely flavorful. Has the bitterness in the corners of your mouth feeling. Its piney and floral.		Mouthfeel is bubbly and a bit dry.		Overall a very well rounded session ipa.

review/text: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. 		smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone.		Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell.		Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.

Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot.		M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation.

review/text: On tap at the EOU faculty lounge in The Big.		Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.

review/text: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double/imperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.

review/text: Reviewed 4/9/09		Ohh Baby!! Love reviewing canned beer. I have been looking forward to this one for about a week now.		Poured from a bright yellow can into a 16ox pint glass. Firm pour yields a 1/8 inch head that holds for a while. Lacing is pretty good. Color is a caramel/copper amber.		Nose- Deep pine, and Floral citrus, orange, some lemon and grapefruit. Gooey caramel.		Taste- Whoa, very nice. Lots of pine. Smooth caramel. Bitter pithy grapefruit, lemon zest. Some light sweetness. Grainy smoothness. Pronounced bitterness. Finishes with some nice floral citrus, lots of candied orange. Very nice.		Mouthfeel- active, slightly oily.		Drinkability- Good. Very hoppy. I love canned beer.

review/text: Pours a clear, amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, some sweet malt, and some earthy malt. Overall, a very tasty IPA and by far the best beer I've ever had from a can. This was practically mind blowing for me to really enjoy a canned beer. Definitely worth a try!

review/text: Poured from the can a slightly-hazed amber gold with a huge frothy off-white head. 		Juicy aroma of grapefruit and pine hops and sweet, bready malts.		Hoppy bitterness upfront with the grapefruit and pine. Sweet malts and caramel offer a good balance.		Lighter bodied, crisp and dry, with a moderate carbonation.		A super sessionable and flavorful IPA from Caldera. A bit steep at $12 a sixer, but then again, I'd much rather have one of these outdoors than most other options.

review/text: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can.		Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.

review/text: 12oz can I picked up at State Line this past weekend.		A: In my Duvel glass, this IPA sits a rather dark amber with an off-white head with good retention and gorgeous lacework.		S: On the nose, there's some heady and bitter pine with some grapefruit pungency. The balance leans towards the bittering hops on this one. Malt presence is light and is easily countered by some citrus and spicy aroma hops		T: Opens up with plenty of bitterness - pine, grapefruit and white pepper. Hop flavor is moderate with a little bit of citrus. Thin malt backbone with a hint of caramel sweetness. Finishes dry and bitter		M: Fairly light in body with good hop bitterness, soft carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. The finish could be improved if there was some resiny character from the hops.		D: This is fairly enjoyable, the bitterness just might be a bit high for my palate

review/text: Got this on a swap from some BA friends. Cool, hippy art can. Pours a clear medium amber with a pillowy, almost nitro-looking head that stays put.	The first aroma is hops, as you would expect in a West Coast IPA. Lots of grapefruit and pine, a little bit of grass. Brown sugar and lightly toasted bread malts are present.	Flavors mimic the aroma pretty closely. Lots of grapefruit, pine and grass. The malts come through more than in the aroma. 	Medium bodied. Somewhat low carbonation, again resembling a nitro beer. A little sticky/oily.	Pretty drinkable. Nice flavors and body. Not too boozy, but not quite sessionable.	A quality entry in a crowded beer style. I was glad to try it, but there are just as many good ones available locally too.

review/text: A - Dark gold, almost amber ale with a nice, dense, bubbly head that descends slowly and leaves nice lacing. The head revives with a swirl.		S - Pine and grapefruit with a touch of wet leather.		T/M - Hops and leather with a touch of pine and grapefruit. Nicely supportive carbonation. The trick was to let it warm up a bit. As it warmed, it became more complex and rich. When it was cold it came across as a bit thinner so choose/make your preference.		D - The alcohol is in check. If you choose to drink it cold it's ideal as a warm weather ale. Otherwise, enjoy it with seafood (e.g., mussels). Yum.

S: Not a blast of hops on the nose as expected from a NW IPA but improves as it warms. Smelling of grapefruit, oranges & a smell ever so familiar to when I lived in Eugene (Ganja).		T: Amazing flavor! Starts out off-dry kind of sweet, then BAM the hops hit! Very nice bitterness with pine & citrus flavors & a little bit of that Ganja flavor from the nose.

review/text: Thanks to unclederby!		Poured into Sam Adams BL glass. Pours honey color, hazy, good amount of carbonation with a fluffy three finger head. As the head slowly decreases, clings heavily to the side of the glass; nice show.		A rather tame aroma consisting of grass, floral-pine, sourdough, with a touch of funk. Images of that candy I got every Halloween, bottlecaps, creep into my head. 		Piney, earthy hops attack the palate; more flower than citrus in this NW IPA. Just enough caramel and bready malt to provide a little balance with touches of butterscotch. The finish is a grassy, bitter greens that drys the mouth to Sahara like levels. A touch of alcohol too. 		The can tells the story with a handful of hops boiling a black pot, did I mention the can? A tasty brew that cures whatever ails 'ya; hophead elixir. I could drink a lot more of this and dig the 6.5%.

review/text: 12oz can into nonic.		Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever.		The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued.		Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied.		This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.

Somewhat subdued hoppy aroma, tropical orange & citric aromas, malts come through well, bisquit, toast. Nice.		Toasty, bready malts give way to the nice hoppiness, grapefruit, orange peel, lime zest, some caramel sweetness, somewhat herbal.		Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy, juicy, yeah juicy. 		Another highly drinkable brew from Caldera. Wish I had access to this all the time. Would be frequently in my camping stock & disc golf bag.

review/text: 12 oz can into a pint glass. 		Pours a crystal clear caramel amber with a couple fingers of poofy off-white head. A thin and foamy layer of retention flares up very nicely, leaving a big creamy cascade of sticky lacing behind. The aroma is rich with a ton of tropical fruit character, along with floral notes, spice, and some bread. 		The taste is a moderatley bitter and spicy hop profile that is well balanced by citrus and toasted bready malts. I'm not getting a lot of sweetness out of the backbone but it's enough to even things out. Finishes with a dry lingering combo of bitterness and spice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an extremely mellow and creamy feel. Very easy feeling overall. 		I've been wanting to try some of Caldera's offerings and this didn't disappoint. Nicely balanced IPA flavors with a big drinkibility and I love the fact that this is in cans. Nice!

review/text: Six pack of cans from the Davis, Ca Co-Op. Pours a nice reddish amber with a strong white head of fine bubbles. Head thins to a milky skin. Laces uniformly but in a bit of a watery manner. Smells strongly of grapefruits, oranges and pine needles. Hop oils on the nose smell great and work well with a nice sweet smelling malt undertone. Flavor is more grapefruit, and quite bitter. Hops are strong and tasty and nearing the amount of bitterness i generally consider to be too much, but without quite getting there. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy. Drinks very well; another good beer in a can.

review/text: A: Bright yellowish amber with a nice stickiness to the head, though retention is a little flaky and quick to recede.		S: Woody and piney... a hint of spiciness. Almost like a dash of raw nutmeg has been added to the hoppy blend. Quite kind on the nose		T: A pungent IPA... woody, earthy, musty flavours. Some spiciness, and a little citrus rind. No real sweetness or "malt balance" on this one... pretty much straight up bitter.		M + D: Moderate carbonation, a rather heavy but creamier body. Flavour is good, but maybe a bit one-dimensional in some ways. If the price were better, I'd come back to this one again, but like the Pale Ale, it simply is not at this time.

review/text: nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.

review/text: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass.		Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a small creamy white head that dissipates slowly to a sizable ring and leaves sporadic lacing.		The aroma is well balanced with the citrus showing out up front with some grapefruit, orange peel and some grassy hops. There is a also a fairly big caramel sweetness balancing it out.		The taste has the same citrus hops up front with grapefruit in the forefront, but it seems to be a bit earthier than the aroma suggests with a sturdy malt backbone that gives way to a finishing bitterness from the hops.		The mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly prickly with strong carbonation.		This is a very drinkable IPA and one of the better beers in a can I've had in a while. Very tasty.

review/text: Had this at the 27 Public House in Spokane, brought in a can and poured into a pint glass.		Poured a nice copper/ burnt orange. nice half inch white head that laced well for most of the pint.		Smelled like dried apricot and hops, hint of malt in the background in teh aftermath		Tasted like it smelled, very nice balance of hops and malts, with dried fruit in there too.		Drank 2 cans very easily, and a nice smooth mouthfeel. Total suprise, and a good find

M - Bitter, lets you know it's an IPA and it ain't messing around. 		D - Good, but average Joe would need to appreciate and expect a bitter beer.

review/text: So...not only does ThirstyHopHead agree to send me two bottles of the 2008 Abyss in a recent trade, but he drops three beers I've never heard of in as extras. Including Caldera IPA. Not only never heard of the brew, no clue the brewery even existed. 		The pour is the initial use of a Flying Fish glass that marcpal sent me recently. Clearly he read my mind about the need for smaller glasses in the house. Thanks Marc!		The 12 oz. goes into the tulip with about an ounce or so to spare. The smell knocks me for a loop, a bitter, disgusted, angry, fucked-up hophead's dream searing my nostrils. I was kind of looking at this as a nice, gentle way to start off the night. What did I get myself into? 		Ah, I see. I got myself into a kick-ass IPA I've never heard of before. The taste is aggressively hopped, pleasantly oily, bitter, sharp, clean, & all the things a good IPA claims to be. Wow. First-class IPA. Really, really good. 		I could drink these all night. 		Thanks Mr. Hophead, I am going to put this on my wants list hoping people will drop a can or two in as extras. The only thing preventing me from trading for it is the existence of a local brew, Surly Furious, maybe you've heard of it. This is...almost...no. I can't even type it. It's close. Great beer.

S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes.		T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate.		M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish.		D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.

review/text: A decent pour from the can produces an almost three-finger thick, light tan colored head in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip. The beer is a light amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, orange / red tinged, full copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma is definitely hoppy, though not aggressively so, there is also a fair amount of malt character that accentuates a sticky hop character. Aromas of candied orange zest, ruby red grapefruit, caramelized oranges, some touches of pine and green herbal notes and, towards the finish, a touch of cracker like grain and lightly toasted malt.		Slightly sweet, somewhat light bodied, but definitely hoppy. A nice bitterness clings to the palate and lingers for quite some time in a long, bitter, dry finish. Up front the bitterness takes on a decidedly herbal note with touches of hemp, biting pine flavors and a bit of herbal / green-grassy notes. This is definitely nice and quaffable, it is not overly sweet nor thick for an IPA, though the hop character definitely tends to cling to the palate. The first sips, as well as sips where I have gone and done something else for a while, have a much more prominent citrus hop character (with orange zest, grapefruit notes, kumquat and perhaps a touch of lychee); otherwise the herbal and bitter hop flavors dominate.		The flavor is much more harsh and aggressive than the aroma suggested, but it will certainly still be enjoyable for the hop heads out there. A solid IPA, that could actually use a touch more malt, or to dial back the herbal and bitter hop character.		Purchased: Liquid Solutions

review/text: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing.		Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. 		Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. 		Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. 		Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a 20oz imperial pint.		A: Pours a completely clear golden orange color with a firm off-white/light-orange cap of puffy foam. Lots of bubbly and sticky lace left behind. Lazily carbonated.		S: Big piney hop nose right off the bat. I also pulled out aromas of orange, caramel, grapefruit, tangerine, and a pinch of pineapple. Also noticed a medicinal/aspirin type aroma that was strangely apealing.		T: Big bitter pine with a fine coating of toasted malt and caramel. This sports a plethora of citrus and tropical fruit flavors with elements of cut grass and metal.		M: Spicy astringency that's balanced by the sweet and creamy caramel malt. Finish turns bitter and dry with an underlying peppery hop quality that keeps things pretty interesting.		D: This was a very nice surprise. This IPA drinks exceptionally well. Excellent balance between bitter & dry hops and sweet maltiness.

review/text: Can as an extra from flexabull in a trade - thanks! Poured into a traditional American pint glass.		Appearance: Pours a healthy-looking clear orange amber-bodied brew. A mild pour coaxed a good one-plus finger white foamy head with above average staying power that leaves some sticky, creamy lacing as it fades away, sort of randomly thrown across the sides of the glass. Very good start.		Aroma: Great west coast aroma. That one-two citrus-pine combo is so traditional for a reason - it smells great. This one's not overstated, and compliments the roasted, sticky, doughy malt backbone well. 		Taste: Expertly balanced. It's not too bitter or too malty, and the maltiness isn't too sweet or too dry. Hop profile is a little milder than I'd like, but more so than a lot of IPAs - I'm just very demanding of my hops, I suppose. Leafy floral notes, pine, and lots of grapefruit makes for a good hop profile.		Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied, fairly fluffy, but very even and creamy, precisely what you'd expect from the look of the head. Carbonation is precise and pronounced, a little prickly, and the hop oils increase the slickness factor ever so sightly.		Drinkability: A great, drinkable, sessionable IPA in a can that hits all the right notes without knocking any of them out of the park. But that's not what you're looking for with this one. Portable, tasty, aromatic, pleasant looking ... this one definitely comes recommended, and many thanks to flexabull for sending this one my way.

review/text: Caldera IPA flows out of the can into a nice clear orange/light amber color with a nice fluffy white head. Nose smells of west coast hoppage and some malts. Taste follows, good grapefruit hop flavor with some spiciness in there as well. A good malt backbone, but not overwhelmingly sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty much just what it should be, but could be just a touch thinner. Drinkability is very good here, as this one is defenitley summer slammable. Overall a good beer, solid session IPA, and a good option for those seeking craft portability. Its not Oskar Blues, Its not Surly, but its still craft beer in a can baby.

review/text: From a 12 oz. can....Dropped hard into my imperial pint produces a big white fine head, over a hazy apple juice looking fluid. Crisp citrus smell with a hop presence as well. I taste hops right up front, with a dry bitter citrus finish. Much better as it warms. The head pretty much disappeared, but left some nice lacing. I can absolutely get a subtle tangerine smell from the beer, but a strong smell from the can. This is a very good canned beer. I wish I could buy it around here.

review/text: A- Nice golden copper color. A thick foamy one finger head.		S- A wonderful smell of sweet grapefruit is strongly coming through.		T- The sweet taste didn't come though in the taste. The taste is a bit on the maltier side. The hops taste does give some DIPA's a run for their money. The hoppyness is very much there and it is good.		M- The beer is smooth and easy in the mouth. A little drying of the tongue, but not too bad.		D- Easy to drink, don't have to choke it down.

Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence.		Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.

review/text: Caldera IPA is my new best friend. And I'm wondering if the can has something to do with it. 		For decades canned beer deserved the stigma attached to it. The aluminum adversely impacted the taste, lending a tawdry metallic quality that was the hallmark of industrial beer production. This problem has been solved in recent years by coating the inside of the can with a food-grade polymer that effectively keeps the beer off the aluminum. No more unsavory beer can taste. 		Today it's not merely a matter of acknowledging that canned beer "works." It's now prudent to ask whether it's an altogether better idea than beer in a bottle. And Caldera's IPA is a fine candidate for the notion that canned beer is an idea whose time has come. 			Caldera IPA's aroma is floral and leafy. The leaf is so fresh it's almost sticky. It imparts a tall airy head of majestic suds amid lively carbonation in a sunny topaz color. The body is vivid and clear though marred by a few wayward flocs.			The taste reminds me of Fire Station 5 with perfectly posited bittering that takes your hand and walks you through a lush garden of herbal hop flavor. Piney, peachy elements interweave from an ideal balance of hop flavor and malty sustenance. And the mouthfeel is flawless - plush, meandering, and exquisitely quaffable. Even the head delights in its own fluffiness.			An ideal go-to beer for any occasion.

review/text: Got this from a trade with BeerZack - thanks man!		Poured a 12oz can into a snifter		Appearance - Produced a creamy 1 finger head that lasted for quite a while before dissipating to a thick crown across the surface of the brew. Light lacing is left behind as the head shrinks. It is a hazy transparent golden orange color.		Smell - Damn, this smells pretty awesome. The scent of candied orange explodes out of the glass. Almost like Sunkist orange soda spiked with hops - but without the artificial orange scent. Very bright. Citrus rind and sugar and the primary scents that I detect. 		Taste - The taste is nice, but nowhere near as nice as the scent. Citrusy hops and slight cracker-like malts make an appearance in the initial flavor, with a thin sugary sweetness in the middle and then runs flat - all before a surge of bitter hops rounds out the backend and aftertaste. It isn't balanced by any means - but it is tasty. If only it tasted as good as it smelled.		Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is pretty nice. There is are tiny, very fine textured carbonation bubbles that prick the tip of your tongue as you sip, and then runs creamy by the time it hits the back of the throat. I would have enjoyed a little more carbonation in the backend to liven things up, but I always enjoy a beer that can be both crisp and creamy at the same time.		Drinkability - This is a very solid brew. It is a nice, easy drinking beer, but I wish that it had a more balanced flavor - or at least a flavor that tasts as good as it smells. The hops seen to be a little out of whack - I would have enjoyed a more prevalent malt profile. But it smells awesome, and I do get my hop fix. If this was available in Texas, I could easily see this becoming a part of my regular beer rotation.

Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.

review/text: 12oz can purchased at Bottles in Millwood for $1.69. No freshness date. First time I'd seen this beer. 		Poured a golden orange color with a creamy, two-inches of off-white head. Strings of lace were seen clinging to the sides of my glass.		The nose was citrusy in a grapefruity sort of way, with some peppery notes. Definitely seemed like a WCIPA. 		A bit more herbal in the taste than in the nose, and there's a pineyness that didn't seem to come through in the aroma, all in addition to the citrus noted in the nose. Bone dry finish. While diverse in terms of hoppiness, the malts seem a little too anemic for the beer's own good, and the hops aren't beefy enough to be a true scorcher of an IPA. 		Fairly light bodied, though with a mouthfeel that is mildly slick with hop resin.		A mediocre IPA. Beefing up the malts to provide a bit more counterpoint would improve it. Should I find myself in Ashland, I'll give this a try on tap. For now, I'm glad I tried it, but this won't make me switch from Laughing Dog's IPA (my local, go-to IPA)anytime soon.

The aroma features a good dose of toasted and biscuity malt with some piney hops. The taste is sweet malt up front with a lingering piney hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, Caldera IPA is another solid PNW IPA that packs the hops. Recommended.

review/text: Served cool from a 12 oz can into a Boston Lager glass.		Pours crystal clear with a fluffy off-white head that leads loads of lacing on the glass. Nice orange light-amber color bordering on light coppery tone.		Aroma is just loaded with citrusy, tangerine hops. Not much subtlety there.		Flavor is a lot more complex. There's tangerine, pine, and floral hops. A touch of caramel and a touch of maltiness, and even a touch of grassiness. Nicely "balanced" (for what it is) but practically speaking, still hop-heavy.		Mouthfeel is suitably bitter, but not near the max of the style, and has a nice dry finish--refreshing compared to many heavy, sugary IPAs in its class. 		Drinkability is good, but the bitter front and dry finish might actually go better with a bit less flavor and aroma. This is a nice complement to their Pale Ale, one of my favorite beers, and I think I like this one's hop bill even better. 		Highly recommended.

review/text: Thanks to rayjay for the extra in a trade.	Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tight white head that laces like glue.	Smells of massive amounts of hops, damn near all of them. Lots of citrus and pine, with some caramel malt as well.	Tastes wonderfully hoppy, tons of pine and citrus yet an almost grainy note, also slightly vegetal. There is a lot of malt here to back things up, there's a nice tight carbonation and it feels dense.	Very easy to drink on after an evening of flying frizbee.

review/text: Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, big hop note, citrus/pines, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some nice citrus/pine tones, with some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very solid IPA (in a can too), definitely recommended.

The mouthfeel is very good, I like the better then medium body as well as the level of carbonation.		The drinkability is good really worth a try. Prosit, MK

review/text: Bright, colorful 12 oz. can poured into yer average pint glass.		Pint: Color is dark straw. Aggressive pour yields a light head that reduces quickly. Moderate carbonation. Loads of cloudy-white lacing down the glass.		Nose: Ahhh...ye olde tell-tale Simcoe and Centennial THC-esque resiny/floral hops. Very sweet and estery! Lovely.		Taste/Palate: Sharp, grassy/floral/resiny hops with light malt couples for a nicely refreshing Ale. Liquid sunshine...truth in advertising here, folks.		Mouthfeel: Not to heavy/not to light. Really nicely balanced here. Gimme another quaff. This IPA goes down very, very easy.		Drinkability: The perfect PNW Summer Session IPA. The best IPA i've had out of a can/as good or better than many in bottles. Don't let the packaging keep you cuz i can't find anything not to like here. A clear Blue Ribbon IPA. I'll be coming back. Thanks to you, Caldera Brewing. Another brew worthy of inclusion in the proud pantheon of PNW hoppy Ales. Try one. You'll drink two, maybe three?

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into a nonic, the Caldera's IPA is a clear bronze with a moderate sized white head that quickly fades to a thick skim, leaving scattered lace. Like their Pale Ale I just reviewed, this is the first time I've ever not had this beer in a can, but I'm not nearly as impressed. Served at fridge temp.		Smell is pure, resiny cannabis - ah, Oregon! To be more specific, it's more of the cat piss style, which you probably won't care for unless you have the mental association. I was just working on my goggle tan at Mt. Ashland this past Wednesday, and by the number of heads goofing off with me on a work day, it's obvious this town operates on a slightly slower speed. With a smell like this, I think Caldera's trying to remind us there's always time to chill...		Taste is pungent, resiny hops, firm malt backbone with a big bitter finish. The slightest touch of sweet caramel malt loses the battle to the big buds, which pack enough lupin to knock out Bobby Brown on a 3 day coke binge. 		Mouthfeel is creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. 		Drinkability is average. I like a lot more hop flavor then bitterness, and this IPA is pretty much the opposite, and a bit thick for my taste as well. I'll still give it bonus points for the can, not to mention that dank aroma that I never noticed from the can.

review/text: Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace.		Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops.		Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish.		Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer.		Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.

review/text: Appearance: Pours a hazy copper color with a rocky head that fizzes out quickly, leaving only the sorriest dots of foam on the sides of the pint glass I have ever seen		Smell: Whoa, that's one rank odor; sure, there is a bit of grapefruit, but there also is something in there that is a cross between wet wool socks after a hike and a cat's litter box		Taste: Fortunately, the taste is much better; starts out with with a hint of caramel that becomes infused with a minty grapefruit juice aspect by mid-palate; after the swallow, the bitter flavors dry out the palate, even though there is plenty of residual sugar that rests on the tip of the tongue		Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation		Drinkability: Just hold your nose and enjoy this beer; it's fine stuff

Above average lacing & superior head retention		S: Much grapefruit & some pine hops		T: Biscuitty malt, a touch of honey, then lemony hops & finally a wave of grapefruit hops up front. Bready notes, caramel, & then more grapefruit as this warms. Finishes a little dry, with more grapefruitty hops, & a bit of honey malt. Almost gave this a 4.5		MF: Pretty smooth with some chewyness & excellent carbonation & balance 		Drinks pretty easy, nice to find another great canned beer out there! Good AIPA

review/text: Thanks to Hoppiness for sending me this nice extra.		Pours a nice amber color, between a caramel and apple juice hue. A soft inch of foam quickly forms and trickles slowly to a thin layer, leaving behind some lacing on the side of the glass.		Very decent hop aroma. There seems to be a good balance of citrus fruits and pine aromas. The traditional grapefruit is there along with some bitter orange and maybe some tangerine and nectarine. The toasted malt aromas and caramel tries to peek from behind the hops but so far it's mostly hops on top. A touch of bread dough and slightly spicy hops.		Taste is of bitter citrus, citrus zest, and pine with a slightly metallic flavor in the finish. Toasted malts and toasted bread with just a hint of caramel make up the malt backbone. I'm getting a lot of lemon flavor on the finish.		Medium mouth-feel, nothing major to complain about, pretty decent.

review/text: I was SO pleased to see this at my local liquor store. Finally I have some good locally crafted canned beer that I can take into the wilderness this summer, and that makes me very happy. 		Pours a bright light gold color with a very nice white head.		Aromas are very earthy, and resin like. There is also a hint of hard candy sweetness. Very nice nose on this one.		Beer has a very hoppy flavor to it. Mostly like the aromas, earthy and resin like, with some pine like flavors as well. There is a bit of subtle underlying creamy malts, and a finish that is crisp, tart, and bitter.		Mouthfeel is thick and full. Very nice feel for an IPA.		Drinkability is good. This is a nice IPA. Very solid, well made, and tasty. The flavors are actually surprisingly strong, almost DIPA like. This is still a very nice beer that I am glad is now available to me, and in a can too!

The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.

review/text: Ordered this from Liquid Solutions with my Abyss order. Pours a dark yellow, with a good deal of white foam which sticks to the glass. Smells like a strong IPA, citrusy. Taste is where the problem was. Hardly any citrus taste at all, no malt either, just a one-dimensional sour bitterness that was very unpleasant. Not happening and not drinkable at all. I couldn't finish this one.

review/text: Appears semi haze copper orange body glows when held to the light, large bubbled off white head clings to my pint with thick chunky even lacing between each sip. Aroma is chalk full of hops grapefruit, floral, and piney varieties blend wonderfully tickle the nose with citrus peel like fury. As it warms more of a complex earthiness with mild tree bark notes ring out but underneath all those hops a subtle layer of malt sugars arise bringing out sweet candy like notes. Flavor is upfront with brash bitterness yet enough malt sweetness comes out to party, this is west coast style IPA all the way. Hop bitterness reigns supreme with grapefruit citrus peel bitterness and more of that earthy dirt layer coming through. Mouthfeel the hop bitterness consumes your palate it really sticks around it makes you feel like you have to scrape the hops off your tongue, I love it. Once again I love the can format, this is great to get this much hop flavor out of a near 6%abv brew coming right out of a can. Next time I hit up an outdoor event where drinking takes place I will remember this beer and wish I had at least a case on hand. Very green yet biscuit malts and mild caramel twang make so drinkable the palate gets used to those brash bittering hops and adjusts to all the other flavors my palate has a found it's equilibrium and no shit this is an outstanding IPA in a can. Hoppier than Gordon DIPA.

review/text: IPA from a can, oh man. This is a good beer.		I opted for the DFH pint glass here and the ale pours out a crystal clear orange with a copper grapefruit hue. A white two-finger head tops off a good looking beer. Nice lacing.		Tantilizing bouquet: floral and perfumey hops accented by a strong citrus presence. The overall effect of hops and malt is sweet and tangy.		Flavors are nicely balanced with just a slight bent towards the hoppy side. Orange and grapefruit mingle with spicy and floral and it's all about centennial hops. Whatever it's hop makeup, it's tasty.		It's weighty on the palate with a somewhat grainy texture and ample carbonation.		I could drink this regulary, it's damn good and I'm tempted to compare it to Two Hearted Ale. Seriously.

review/text: The whole canned microbrew thing is really taking off. With Surly, Caldera, and others now proving that canned beer can be as good or better than bottles, I tihnk in another 5 years the market will explode. 		Brick/rusty orange flows into my pint glass from the brightly designed can. Smaller head, though the lacing sticks to the side of my glass with tenacity. 		Aroma is a bit weak compared to other PacNW IPA's. However, after the brew warmed up a bit, there was a noticable improvement in the strength. Noticed hops of course. More sweet florals that other IPAs. Grapefruit, lemon, cannabis. 		Flavor was superb. For the first second, I notice a sweet smoothness. Then the hops set in and I am awash in bitter pine and citrus. Again, cannabis notes as well. The finish has caramel and bitter earthen/soil characteristics. 		I really like this one, and get no metallic or other "can"-like flavors. (not that I expected to). I've got a 6-pack, and I would like to drink at leas tone straight from the can, it seems like the thing to do.

review/text: 12 ounce can purchased from Liquid Solutions in Oregon for two dollars, never heard of this brewery and went out on a limb when trying this one		Poured into my Russian River pint glass with a golden copper color and a 1/2 silky white head that held its ground for about five minutes, left lots of lacing as most West Coast IPAs seem to do		Smell was lots of floral accents, strong piney hops, different kinds of citrus, particularly lemons and grapefruit, some malt was also evident in the aroma		Taste was nice and dry like I like my India Pale Ales, hops attacked at the beginning and the finish, remaining bitter the entire time through, some sweetness was caused by the citrus but malt was not really there because of how dry this taste was, another great beer out of a can with a distinct taste, floral parts made this one better than a lot of generic IPAs, nice long lasting and crisp finish		Nice full body and just the right amount of carbonation give this one a good mouthfeel		Could drink a six pack of these because they are light and only six percent, cannot wait to try other beers from this brewery in the future

review/text: Polished brew kettle coppery orange with butter rum edges. The good looking crown is some combination of ivory, ecru and pale orange. It has the look and leaves the lace of a beer that contains a generous amount of hop resins. At least I hope so.		The nose is nicely hoppy, but it isn't explosively hoppy. I blame the fact that the brewers decided to use too much Munich and crystal at the expense of pale malt. The hops (Crystal, Galena, and Centennial) provide grapefruit and orange esters, along with a strong whiff of ganja. Close to excellent, but no cigar. Edit: by the last ounce... cigar.		I feel the same way about the flavor... at least after two mouthfuls. Who knows what time, warming and the rest of the can might accomplish? These guys definitely love to hop their beer, but then that's almost a requirement in Oregon, isn't it? I wish the website listed the IBUs. I'm thinking 70ish.		The sturdy malt backbone, again, contains a healthy amount of toasted earthiness from the Munich and steely caramel from the crystal. It also provides an underlying sweetness that keeps things from being more arid on the back end than they already are. Caramel-soaked orange and grapefruit pith and peel zings across the tongue with each mouthful, leaving shallow alpha acid furrows rather than deep trenches.		The mouthfeel is IPA medium; perhaps a bit more full due to a wonderful creaminess as it gains a few degrees. The amount and feel of the carbonation strikes me as just about right. Are all 12 ounces gone already?		Prior to Surly blowing the entire concept sky-high, Caldera Pale Ale was my favorite canned beer. IPA is at least as good. It's a terrific, drinkable beer that I have no trouble recommending to anyone, hophead or not. If you have a few slots to fill in your Liquid Solutions order, you could do much worse than to fill them with either Caldera Pale Ale or Caldera IPA.

Great retention, and lace as one might expect from a northwest IPA. 		Nice blast of hops up the nose, grapefruit, tangerine, floral and pine. Smells quite fresh. Good amount of malty notes in the nose as well.		Fair amount of sweetness up front, along with a decent blast of citrusy, floral and slightly piney hops. Seems to fade into a bit of grassy flavor as well. Very nice.		Good body, very easy to drink. This seems pretty solid to me, and an easy drinker.

review/text: Thanks to Mcallister for hooking it up with this can.		Poured from 12oz can into a pilsner glass.		Appearance- Beer pours a hazy dark orange with a nice frothy head with large bubbles filling about a 3 finger head. A chill haze is present, light lacing.		Smell- Big floral hop smacks me right in the face, this smells like a nice fresh IPA. Smells like there is a decent amount of malt on this one to balance as well.		Taste- Rich fluffy hops and a very nice light malt bringing in the rear. This is a nice balanced IPA, there is a bit of metallic can character as well. 		Mouthfeel- The metallic flavor comes in and lingers on the mouthfeel. The carbonation seems to wear down quite a bit as well. Still a medium bodied, crisp beer.		Drinkability- The drinkability on this IPA is quite good. This is the sort of beer one could stand to have by the 'suitcase' although it has more of the maturity for the established craft beer drinker. Great swilling beer.

review/text: Lovely pour colored similarly to unpolished copper. The head is a pillow of sustained goodness. Off white, and just won't go away. A beer that when you take a sip the head sticks on your mouth for a foam mustache. Thick completely engulfing lace completely down the glass.		Damn I love the canned beers. Fresh smack of in your face hops. Lovely floral tones with a piney aspect with a hint of stone fruits. A thick caramel toffee really brings things together and adds a sense of sweetness to the aroma.		Very floral and perfumey on the finish. Slightly lacking on the mid palate and on the finish a gritty almost metallic hop bitterness. Caramel malt rests behind the floral tones and could be a little more pronounced. A bit of peach and blood orange also say hello. 		Mouth is lacking the creamy thickness that more malting could have brought and it dissapoints. This beer just barely misses from being great, otherwise a very solid IPA.

The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.

Smell is nice of citrusy hops, along with some notes of pine sap and herbs.	Taste is of the mentioned aromas with caramel and citrus notes battling it out with a mild spiciness going on in the flavor.

review/text: Poured from a 12 oz.can to a pint glass; lists on the label at 6.1% ABV. That lemon-yellow package, though new on the maket, is already easy to spot... Another classic phrase regarding keeping the beer at a proper temperature: "Live Product. Keep Cool, Just Like You".		A: Pours a light amber color and immaculately clear with almost 4-fingers of billowing sandy tan-colored head. Fades to about 1/2-finger. What remains is both rocky and creamy, full of both bubbles and crust. Hardly any carbonation and a faint suspended haziness. 		S: Aroma is all citrus, full of pithy grapefruit and traces of lemon and sweeter orange. What caramel malt there is is folded into a neat envelope of juicy hops.		T: Pithy bitterness sprays from this IPA from the first taste. There is very little malt getting through here; this is an fairly unbalanced hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit bitterness and pine resin - very little caramel malt or other sweetness getting through. 		M: Medium mouthfeel, but with a long-lasting hoppy cling. This has orange, grapefruit and pine nesting on the center and back of the tongue. Carbonation is low and somehow the mouthfeel is fleeting and just a little thin.		D: A good IPA, certainly worthy of grabbing one (or a 6-pack) if in Oregon. I think hopheads will really enjoy the full citrus-hop flavor from this, although I found it just a little one-dimensional/overbearing. A flavorful IPA I'd certainly have again, however...

review/text: I stopped in at one of my favorite gourmet beer spots on my way home from work the other night; low and behold, I spot an IPA in a can. In a CAN!		If I hadn't had two, I wouldn't be able to report on color. I simply had to experience this straight from the can. Why? To me, canned beer is typically reserved for frat boys, red necks, and those who live under a bridge, so the inherent conundrum of a can to my lips with a tasty IPA flowing across my palate was too hard to resist. As confusing as it was, I must say, it was worth it!		Caldera IPA - can #2		Nice burned orange color with a good two-finger head thanks to a quick pour. Good lacing all the way through to the bottom of the glass.		Strong floral hop, lots of citrus on the nose.		Very tasty! I think I'll have another.

review/text: Pours a bronze/amber color with a thick, creamy, fluffy white head. Dies down and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is highly, bitterly hopped. I think I can smell mt. hood hops, pine, black pepper, grass/weedy smell, earthy. Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy.

review/text: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.

review/text: Served on tap at the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Pours a slightly hazy golden color topped by a beautiful creamy white head. Nice, creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Nose of fresh, spicy hops and a touch of light sweet malt. Palate is redolent of spicy hops, light sweet malt, and notes of pine, black pepper, grass, and just a hint of bready sweetness. Body is absolutely perfect - rich, creamy, and without the syrupy character that many stronger IPAs tend to carry. Man, I chose the right one here. I'd drink this every day if it were available where I live.

review/text: I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange/golden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet/sour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry/bitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.

review/text: I had this on tap at Caprils restaurant in Portland, OR. This is great place to go for really inventive food.		The beer was a slightly cloudy bronze orange with a nice white head. Good lacing.		Nice citrus nose. Not, sure, but Im guessing cascade hops. Whiffs of fresh bread as well.		This is a nice solid IPA. A liberal use of hops adds a distinctive citrus bite. Some more floral tones emerge  way through the beer. Seems slightly under malted, but still tasty. 		The carbonation is perfect for this beer and it also has a slightly oily quality. Drinkabity suffers a touch by the slight lack of balance. Still, an enjoyable IPA.

review/text: Bought a 6 pack at my local grocery store. Poured into a stone nonic.		A very pretty and pretty tastey IPA. Comes through with some thick texture and dark fruit flavor initially and transforms into juicy hops finishing with a tad of extreme bitterness. A really well rounded, perfectly B+ IPA that is very cost effective if you're looking for something to knock a few back of and enjoy.

review/text: Bright and Hazy unfiltered red-orange honey color with a light creamy off-white head.		Smell: Big amount of spicy floral aroma. Rose hip, lavender and citrus. Green grass, tomato and cucumber. Firm toasted biscuit malt base. Fresh baked bread and buttered croissant. 		Taste: Natural garden grasses and flowers. Leaf. Pine. Very tasty with subtle bitterness.		Mouthfeel: Full-bodied slighty chewy malts . Light with a bittersweet finish.		Overall: Very good unique IPA. I like the whole flower quality. A little on the high price end and not very available in my area. I'd love to try it on tap.

review/text: Light amber color. Eggshell white head that pours ferociously but disapates quickly leaving foamy lacing. Not too many noticeable bubbles. 		Big time grapefruit and piney hops hit the nose immediately, caramel and some yeasty characteristics.		The aroma matches the taste quite accurately. Sweet caramel with bready yeast mixes with piney and grapefruit hops. Slight metalic bitterness is noted as well but is quite tasty nonetheless.		Light body, light but noticeable carbonation. Very easy to drink although there is a lasting dry bitterness feeling but it leaves the mouth moist. 		This is a pretty straight forward IPA with the bitter hops being the main focus but there is enough sweetness to smooth it out. This is definitely a worthy IPA to check out for Hopheads.

review/text: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.

review/text: A friend of mine brought this beer for me from a trip to Oregon.	It poured a hazy amber orange and produced a about one finger high, white bubbly head. It dissipates fast and leaves good lacing.	The smell is very intense flowery hops, with a nice combination of orange, peach and citrus.	The taste is just like the smell announced. Fruity citrus flavors up front, great hop character in the middle and a bittersweet finish, where some carefully measured orange balances a slight bitter end. Great beer and something I would love to try on tap.

review/text: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA		A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. 		S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral.		T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back.		M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle		O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.

review/text: Poured into pint glass from can.		A: Slightly hazy burnt orange color with a frothy sticky off white head, very sticky lacing.		S: Big pine and grapefruit hop aroma with some sweet malts.		T: Lots of pine up front with a nice mixing of hops and malt in the middle, although staying strong on the hop side throughout. The finish is dry and bitter with a pronounced grapefruit flavor, as well as a some bell pepper.		M: Medium body, crisp medium-high carbonation, dry finish. This IPA has bite but is still very drinkable. Could be due to a slightly low ABV. 		O: I thought this was a very very good IPA. Definitely my favorite in a can so far. Not a bad price either. I found this to be very similar to another IPA that costs at least $2 more for a six pack.

review/text: Pours out a little thin looking weak ice tea color with two fingers of slightly off-white suds and lots of lacing.	Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. 	Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar.	Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable.	Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range.	Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.

review/text: Had at the Flying Saucer in Nashville		Poured a crisp burnt orange with 2 fingers of bright white head. Slowly faded into a thin film but produced excellent lacing.		Big pine notes with some prominant mango notes. Solid caramel malt finish		Taste follows the nose. Great pine resin taste up front with some delicious mango backing it up		A little light in the body for my taste... Good amount of carbonation. Drying hoppy aftertaste. Produced a little bit of hop dragon breath.		Overall, a tasty and refreshing IPA. Great smell and taste but a little on the thin side for my taste. Would not turn another one down by any means. Definitely worth trying

review/text: Thanks to a coworker for trading this bottle to me. She's a big IPA fan and this beer came well-recommended. 		Slightly clear with a moderate haze, medium orange. Two-finger off-white collapsed thin but retaining well with lacing. Pervasive tropical fruity hops, mango and pineapple. Supporting toasted malt makes an appearance, too. Mild herbal notes in the background. Moderate level of toasted malts, herbal hops, medium level of bitterness. Fruity hops sneak in the back-end Medium, dry finish with a lingering hop bitterness. Medium-light bodied with a moderate/moderate-high level of carbonation. 		Great hop nose and a well-formed flavor make this a good example of the IPA style. Could use more diversity in the flavor department.

review/text: Appearance: the color is an amber hue. The head developed nicely to about a finger width thick and then subsided to a glaze of fine foam covering the top if the glass. The glass sides become coated in the fine lacey foam that seems to hug the glass.		Smell: piney hops and citrus. The aroma is pleasantly hoppy and inviting.		Taste: hoppy with a bitter flavor that is similar to a nice dark (I mean real dark) chocolate the most obvious taste is grapefruit, but there is also bright,garden fresh green pepper hint. Marathon aftertaste!		Mouthfeel: medium body and carbonation. Hops and malt seem pretty well balanced with a slight advantage to the hops.

review/text: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. 		Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. 		Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. 		The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.

review/text: 12oz can with no freshness date. Poured to a Duvel tulip.	Hard pour yields 2 full inches of white head that hangs on for a while leaving very sparse lacing. Really nice medium amber color with a slight chill haze.		Smell is mostly malty with some tropical fruit and floral notes. I swear other cans from the 6-pack had a fuller nose though. Taste is really good similar to the nose with a nice pine finish, sticky and resiny with a full bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect: medium carbonation and medium body.		Very enjoyable brew overall and extremely drinkable. I do feel there were inconsistencies between cans though, but I still very much enjoyed this one.

S: Mango and papayas with some citrus notes and some resinous notes as well. Malts are sweet and subdued.		T: Lightly bittered, oxidized malts. Some raisin notes and some nice citrus (grapefruit and orange) flavors. The malts are quite oxidized and that's just not cool. Not bad, but not great either.		M: Medium bodied with surprisingly low carb. Lightly slick finish.		O: About average. Good nose, but taste is nothing to call home about. Decent hit for a can.

review/text: Poured into a small snifter. 		Light sunset orange color with perfect clarity and a grayish-white head that deposits speckles of lace. 		Honeyed biscuits and spicy hops in nose. Clean, understated and balanced. 		Calderas website says this was brewed with Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo -- which has me confused, because my taste buds are calling these hops earthy and spicy, with none of the usual snap of American-grown hops. Perhaps its the abundance of malt throwing things off  theres a lot of toasty biscuits, bread and uncooked pale barley before the clean, dry finish.		The medium body exhibits a very light touch of carbonation and soft silky fizziness. Lightly bitter.		I found Calderas IPA very similar to their pale, with maybe a half step up in each category. While both beers are enjoyable enough, they lack the hoppy bite I crave in American-brewed versions of this style.

review/text: 12 oz. canned poured into a pint glass.		Appearance - Dark gold to light amber body with a substantial white head. The foam sticks to the glass and the lacing is decent.		Smell - I get hops, some grapefruit and some pine. It's more of a biscuit malt aroma, though. Kinda smells like an ESB.		Taste - Hops at first, more pine in the flavor than in the smell. Malty behind it. Biscuit malts and a touch of caramel. Not sweet at all, but malty nonetheless. Tastes like an ESB, too.		Mouthfeel - Just a tad heavier than medium bodied. Feels heavier because of low carbonation. Has the feel of an ESB, too!		Overall - Not as hoppy as I would like from an IPA. Better than the other Caldera beer I've had, though. Not something I'd look for.

S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant.		T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. 		O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often.		-Cheers

review/text: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.

review/text: I purchased a six pack of this at Peabodys in Boone. I had not idea that the six pack was going to $12. Seems pricey to me, cans or bottles. Anyhoo. I cracked open the first one and was immediately greeted by a ton of fresh hop aroma in the face. Awesome! Piney and citrusy with some oiliness. 		Pours from the can into a pint glass an amber color with a nice, one inch size and very foamy head with great retention and lacing. 		Taste is pretty darn spot on. Slightly sweet up front with plenty of hop flavor and hop bitterness at the end. There seems to be a bit of alkalinity that adds some artificial and chalky bitterness that keep this one from being a classis. As it is, this is a real winner. 		Some may disagree, but this is one hell of a "session" IPA. ABV is kept in check and this one goes down so smooth. Maybe it was worth the $12. Actually, I say it was.

review/text: Was expecting it to be tasty, and tasty it was indeed. Nice golden orange appearance, hardly any head. ** Taste is above par for an American IPA, I could throw back many of these no problem. 	This is a great little IPA, and will be coming back to it time and time again.

review/text: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.

review/text: 12 oz can. No canning dates. Reviewed 6/3/11.		Opaque amber body. One-finger, light tan head. Dense with tightly packed bubbles. Settles very slowly, leaving lacing on the glass and a thin, creamy topping.		Tons of pine hops, with aromas of resin and pitch. Floral hops as well. Caramel malts and a touch of apricot sweetness.		Quick hitting flavors at first, with biscuit malts followed by bitter pine hops. Very slight raisin flavors appear mid-palate. A grapefruit citric bite develops as well. There's a long lasting, drying bitterness from the hops, enhanced by high carbonation. Crisp and clean.

review/text: Serving type- 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass.		A- Pours a pretty deep orange color with a nice lacing. 		S- Huge notes of citrus: grapefruit and orange.		T- A good tasting IPA. Nice even bitter hoppy flavor throughout. Can't taste any alcohol which makes for an easy drinking beer.		This is a good West Coast IPA but it is lacking a little when compared with other beers of the same style and region.

review/text: Can pours that golden-brownish color common to malt forward IPAs. Nice big off-white head leaves sticky remnants all over the glass. The nose is mild caramel malts with a restrained, slightly grapefruit hop presence. The taste is pretty mild. Some lightly tropical, but mostly generic bitterness is largely overshadowed by the heavy caramel malt presence (though not a big sweetness - this beer is pretty dry). Seems somewhat out of balance. Mouthfeel is strong in carbonation and a medium body with some malty stickiness. Overall, this is a very drinkable, very (caramel) malt forward IPA with a mild tropical/generic bitterness. Not nearly my favorite, but not bad. I would call it pretty distinctly average.

review/text: I had this very nice IPA on-tap at Brewer's Haven in Boise, Idaho after I had completed a little beer shopping. Poured amber with a nice head and great lacing. Smells very fruity with candied orange peel and grapefruit pith. The taste is very full, with bitter hops, breadiness. Sharp pine and earth in the hop profile. A little chewy in the mouth, but ovarall this is dry, bitter, and delicious.

review/text: Great to see this Oregon brewery now in my area.Poured a deep hazed burnt orange with a tight formed slight off white crown that held well,big citric aromas with a bit of pine resin,a biscuit dough aroma lends a little maltiness to the mix.Deep grapefruit rind flavors really stand out,this is a true American ipa with its hop forward profile,a lightly sweet biscuit dough malt base stands up well to the big hop presence.A solid beer,to me what an American ipa should be.

review/text: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. 	Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.

review/text: 12oz can -&gt; nondescript pint		A ~ Steady pour reveals very red body with pretty good sized head. Stickyyy lacing. Appearance is not the highlight of this brew though.		S ~ Perfumey Pine cone & Citrus (Grapefruit and Tangerine)	Grassy as hell, smells wet and fresh.		T ~ Bittersweet is a good word. Grapefruit, heavy pinetrees, kiwi, kumquat, lemon, grainy tree sap, and tea leaves. There is a sugary sweetness in there, but the woody dry hopping curbs it. Subtly malted.		M ~ Good showcase of Good American hops, with a curious sweetness and a very dry finish. Screams for you to drink more. I believe I downed this one in 3 minutes it was that incredible. 		D ~ So damn drinkable, shame it's As much as it is in OK. This is a very unique IPA and is a must try. Could drink ALL day.

review/text: From the can at SAVOR 2011. 		Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.

review/text: Poured from a can into a tulip glass. There was no date on the can so I'm not sure how fresh it was, and thinking my can was a touch old based on my perception vs some of the other reviews.		Aroma - slightly cloudy, murky copper, decent foam that faded quickly but left some lacing around the top of the glass		Smell - very little hop aroma, maybe just a hint of citrus and a little more pine, but really had to work to smell it		Taste - malty sweetness then bitterness, but nothing outstanding in the way of distinct flavors		Mouthfeel - decent carbonation, lower alcohol for an IPA, easy to drink		Overall - I had this at a tasting not too long ago and remembered it being much better, so I'm thinking the can I bought may have been old. That said this is a decent IPA, nice that it's in a can, but also nothing stands out about it, either.

review/text: One of the best IPAs from Oregon (which is saying a lot).		$2 for a 12-oz. can at Full Throttle Bottle in south Seattle--and worth every penny.		Great head on this rosy-orange colored beer. It lets off a strong and unmistakable lychee aroma, which I've smelled on all three separate occasions I've tasted it so far. Flavor has the same lychee up front, with piney/resiny hops backing it up. Carbonation is good and the finish is pleasantly bitter that doesn't linger over-long.		All in all, one great IPA and probably the best thing I've ever drunk out of a can.

review/text: Poured from a 12 oz. can into a shaker pint glass.		A: Very clear, light amber color with over one finger of off-white foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass, showing striking relief near the top of the glass.		S: Peppery and astringent herbaceous hops suggest dryness, with lesser tropical and citrus fruit also detected.		T: Begins dry, with earthy black pepper that seems to be associated with the aromatic hops from the smell. Esters are barely detectable, blending in with and complementing the hops. The fruit flavors give off a funky tropical quality, like durian. Acidity is restrained--detectable but never distracting. Husky toasted grain becomes more assertive in the middle, and moderate bitterness develops in the finish amidst continuing malt and slightly astringent hops.		M: Medium viscosity, smooth and slightly sticky on the palate, with very low carbonation.		D/O: It seems like many of the IPAs made by the smaller production breweries struggle almost predictably with some facet of the style--all in the pursuit to be unique in order to stand apart from the pack. This contribution from Caldera is fairly unique in its qualities, but it manages to stay appealing. Its abv is on the low side of the normal range for the style, adding to its approachable nature. Look for interesting pepper and off-center tropical fruit, but don't expect anything too extreme--this is a beer that still aims to please.

review/text: I dont believe that I tasted the freshest can, I didnt see a date on the can, so cant affirm or deny. Poured from can into a pilsner glass. Nice orange color which fades to yellow on the outside of the beer. 1/4 inch head that laced the whole glass. Picture alone, this looks like an amazing beer.	Smell was barely apparent. I tried several times to get any aroma at all. I do pick up a faint aroma of orange, pineapple and other citrus notes. No pine smell at all.	Taste is average. Not anything surprising or breath taking. No real note supercedes the rest. Faint hints of orange and citrus fade to a very faint sign of pine on the end.	I rated the mouthfeel better after reading the abv. For having 6.1%, its very easy to drink.	My overall attitude of this beer is that it is ok. Not a great one, and not a bad one. Then again I have no idea how fresh my sample was.

review/text: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass.	Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations.	The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste.	It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best.	If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.

Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much).		M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. 		O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly).

review/text: Nice light orange/amber color with lots of head. Big pine and grapefruit nose that screams bright hop flavor will follow, and it does. Taste follows the nose with big grapefruit notes that are followed by tangerine, pine, and maybe a slight pineapple at the end. Malt is light, slightly sweet, and lets the hops shine through very nicely. Not aggressively bitter but bitter enough to make you sip it a little slower, not offensive at all. Very drinkable, nicely priced, and always available where I am, making this one a regular for me.

review/text: A - Pours a very aggressive head! Head is off-white with soapy notes, but primarily foamy. Great lacing stick to the glass. Brew is rich copper/orange color with yellow and red hues. Head is VERY thick and lingers nicely! Head tiers nicely. 		S - WOW. I can smell it from two feet away! Smells like a GREAT IPA. Very rich citrus scent, lots of grapefruit and tangerines. Perhaps a little lime/lemon too. Hop characteristics are like few IPS i've smelled.		T - Buttery smooth on the front side with VERY *slight* bitterness on the backend. One the brew on your tongue is fully oxygenated it get quite bitter. Very unusual grapefruit taste. Very good brew, but a little too bitter for my IPA taste.		M - Amazingly light and fluffy. Perfect carbonation. Creamy and rich mouthfeel that spreads with the brew. The bitterness at the backend slightly bothers me, but would be wonderful with fish, potatoes, steak, or a nice cheese.		O - A very good IPA that drinks wonderfully and smells and looks amazing. It also comes from a can, this makes me VERY happy. I wish I was able to get this brew in CO to take backpacking.		Thanks for a wonderful trade brendaniel!

review/text: Poured from a can into a Sam Adams PP glass. Pours an cloudy yellow with a one finger, foamy white head, which dissipates very quickly. Some nice lacing going down the glass.		Smells of caramel malts and not picking up much of the hops in the nose but my sense of smell at the moment is not the best.		At first taste I get a little hop bitterness followed by caramel with a big piney, resinous hop finish. This is a very tasty IPA.		Medium bodied with very bold flavors. This beer leaves behind that resinous, piney hop flavor after the beer has been swallowed.		I really like this beer. It is most certainly a hop lovers delight. It's fairly low ABV could allow one to drink down a few of these in one sitting. However, the price could limit the number of times I try this, at over 16$ for a sixer.

review/text: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.

review/text: Canning craft brew - I'm a fan. Accessability. You would think it would bring the prices down but thats okay I guess.		From can to pint glass		A: Pours a darker caramel color pale with some orange tints to it. Massive khaki tan head due to bad pour on my part but sticky icky lacing fo' sure!		S: Instant pop of the top is burst of sweet mango and tangerine aromas. Candied orange rinds. Is this a friggin orange soda? I cant get over the smells of citrus oils here. Best fruity and floral nose in an IPA I have come across in a while. Better than Flower Power maybe. 		T: Taste is intense hop bitterness that is just danky hops, resiny pine, and blasts of citrus. Grassy and sassy. I love it! Malts hardly detectable at first but the hops do settle down fairly quickly and give way to this sweet caramelly malt goodness. Soft caramel and sweet cracker. Nice bittery dry finish. Delciousness out of a can.		M: Sticky resinous hops do coat the tongue but overall pretty creamy in texture and peppers out the palate on the finish.		D: Pretty damn nice IPA out of a can I must say. Snowboarding, camping, fishing...they all just got even better. More please.		All I got to say is I need to get up to Oregon.

review/text: Pours amber, bordering on orange. Completely white, fluffy head. Pine sap and floral bouquet for aroma. Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose.		Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great "every day" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.

review/text: The look of this is pretty freaking nice, the coolest part about the look is the contrast between the head and the body. The head is almost completely white, and the body is a reddish, orangey, amber color, it looks more like an amber than an IPA, but the head color and body color look really nice together. I can tell the head is a solid one, it is clearly leaving good lacing, it didn't hang around too long though. If it had better head retention I would probably give this a 4.5, but since that head went a little fast, 4. Nice citrusy hops on the nose, along with a very clean smell. The beer just smells super clean and fresh, like they used really good water or something. You can also pick up a nice malt note in there, it is pretty distant, but for sure there. Maybe some grapefruit in here too, not sure. The smell is very nice though, it smells like a very good IPA. Well on the taste, it for sure has enough hops, it's not a weak IPA, that's for sure. The taste is really just like I detected it would be on the smell, it's really big on the hops, and it has a very small malt note in the back end. Frankly I'm surprised at how much more hop there is than malt, I guess I just haven't had a really good (or hoppy, if you will) IPA in a while. Not super complex other than the basic tastes, but it is super well done none the less. The mouthfeel is also pretty good, nice solid feel to it, not too big, not too small, just right. Drinkability is a little low just because it is so damn bitter, but I can't be upset about that, that just means it's a good beer! Overall a damn good beer, not extraordinarily complex, but a very well done beer, there is really nothing wrong with this beer at all.

review/text: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. 	S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background.	T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. 	M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. 	O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings

review/text: 12oz can poured into a Crate and Barrel Snifter.		A - Pours a clear, dark amber color with a one finger, fluffy off-white color head. The head is sticking around for a really long time. Excellent retention and excellent lacing.		S - This is by far the fruitiest smelling IPA i have ever had the chance of enjoying. Pineapple and mango DOMINATE the aroma. I dont smell any citrus or pine. Some maltiness is pressent, but the fruit dominate the aroma profile for me. 		T - Piny and resiny hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus and pineapple. The flavors are very crisp and clean. The sweetness that i smelled is not as present as i expected. Very well balanced.		M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Well balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Fairly sticky from the resiny hops.		O - A great IPA. The aroma is second to none and it helps that it drinks as well as it smells. Its just high enough in ABV that i wouldn't want to session this beer. I also love the can and think that more beers need to be sold in cans. I will buy this again whenever and where ever i can find it.

review/text: Produces a vast amount of foam with awesome retention, which is off white in color. The body is clear and dark copper colored. 		Aroma is pint and floral along with some toffee notes. 		The brew's taste is a bit sweet in he way of caramel upfront, and quickly dives into a piny finish. 		Feels oily slick from the beginning to the end, but with a mild warm finish.

review/text: Aroma: Not much to this one with very faint hints of floral hops and citrus, maybe a little grassy.		Appearance: A medium amber color with a thick creamy white head that leaves a thick top that follows the beer all the way down the glass.		Taste: Muted grassy hops, orange, balanced well with sweet malt and finishes dry.		Mouthfeel: Medium-light feel to it with mild carbonation.		Overall: Not a bad brew overall, but not great either. Checking Caldera's site on this, it claims to have an assertive hop profile and 94 IBUs. I'm thinking this can traveled a long way and sat for quite some time before being sold to me, because I am not picking up much bitterness or hops. Someone could have told me this was a pale ale with IBUs around 50-60, and I would have believed it. Still, it was an enjoyable beer, and I'll be keeping an eye out for others from this brewery.

Smell is full of citrus and hops. Taste is very good - great hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium. This beer goes down very smooth. Really glad I got a chance to try this beer.

review/text: Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic. Thanks to BA redbird.		This brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.

review/text: A: Poured into a SA perfect pint, a darkened amber with three fingers of head froths forth.		S: Floral and citrus hops that lets a bit of malt through for a superb aroma.		T: The malt is well balanced against the citrus and herbal hops. A really well balanced IPA that brings a varied bouquet of hops to the table and supports it well with a robust malt backbone.		M: Mild to moderately carbonated with a bit of hops stickiness.		D: This is a great IPA that presents a powerful hops profile. This is up there with my favorite IPAs, and the boldness of its big bitter taste despite its canned presentation is a refreshing sight. This makes it the perfect beer to take to the beach or on a hike without sacrificing any flavor for portability and convenience. I've finally found a beer to replace Dale's for pure canned hop power!

review/text: I got a nice head on the pour but the coloring is a much lighter and watery looking amber color than that is expected of most IPA's. The smell is pretty nice. Mostly sweet pineapple but the hops aren't that noticeable. Very sugary as well. But I do have to give it points for being pretty strong in the nose even if it isn't showing bitterness. The bitterness is fairly sharp in the front but it fades into a kind of cheapish sweet corn and cereal like lager. Aftertaste also leaves a lot to be desired. Actually after the initial bitterness there really isn't much other flavor besides the corn and more bitterness. Pretty one dimensional. A bit too overcarbonated and kind of leaves a bad feel in your mouth. Well it is easy drinking. I can give it that. Heard a lot of good things about this beer. It failed to impress me. No canned/best by date so who knows how fresh it is. At $12 a six pack this beer is total fail! I didn't even see the price til it rang up and I thought it was a mistake and had to look at the screen to make sure. Even if it was pretty good that price is pretty bad.

review/text: Thanks to larryi86 for this 12oz can--poured into a Bell's pint glass. Preface, I can recall many a pleasant afternoons spent in SE Portland drinking this at Otto's accompanied by a smoked sausage. 		A- Golden amber color with a whitish head. Not sure if I dropped the can before pouring, but the head was two and half fingers when poured moderately. Reduces to a firm thorough covering the lasts. Plenty of lacing on the glass. No visible carbonation bubbles.		S- Hops! Complex mixture of grapefruit, grassy, and herbal tones. Not much malt. Very very hop forward. 		T- Wish it tasted like it smelled minus the grassy aroma. Bitter at the front and end. I taste white onion throughout. It is quite the hop wallop, but the onion seems to be the main taste (had nothing to eat before tasting, so no lingering food tastes). Minus the onion, I think this would be dead on.		M- Medium body with minimal carbonation. Dry finish on the tongue. Lingers bitter with that onion taste.		D- Still would drink it for nostalgia reasons alone, but it holds up. Perfect for mowing the lawn or a softball game. It is easy to drink.

Slightly sweet malt, huge sapling hop, citrus fruit, big floral, pine and something in this maybe more than one thing is toasted, roasted or something along those lines		T - So bitter up front, hops, citrus hops, floral hops and hops, hops hops. A bit of resin. Nice balanced malty backbone, toasted, earthy and bitter through and though		M - Weed and resin! Puckers the whole mouth with glorious bitterness and a bit of sweet at the end. Sticky and lingers for a long while		D - This is not your average IPA. This is a hop and bitterness beast. Amazing smells and tastes, but if you are frightened of bitters, stay away. If you are like me, enjoy		Final thought - If you like hops, bitterness and weed, this IPA is for you

review/text: Can, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.		Appearance: Pours a darker-than-straw honey color, with some hop haze and carbonation visible. Retained about a finger of off-white rocky head. Very true to the style in appearance.		Smell: Nothing overwhelming but nothing off here, either. Hops, citrus, some grassy-floral componenets as well. To me the malts took a back seat, without letting the hops being overwhelming or one-dimensional. Soft-smelling, I would call it.		Taste & mouthfeel: Essentially the same as the nose, with a grapefruit-like flavor as the main culprit. Hop bitterness makes your tongue tingle initially, and the sharp grapefruit levels out into a slight lingering bitterness. The malts are light and toasty but seem distant. Again, a little 'soft' but not one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is extremely crisp and it dries you out on the back end. I consider this a light bodied beer.		Disgustingly drinkable.		Edit to Note: I was just getting over a cold when I tried this, so I will re-review in the future. If this really is as bitter and hop-forward as some of the other reviewers are saying, I will be upping my grade for this beer.

review/text: I picked this can up while in Nashville, Tennessee. The Caldera is not available in Illinois at this point, so I was excited to try a new West Coast IPA and this was no disappointment. 		APPEARANCE: Brilliant gold-copper in color with a quarter-inch, very homogeneous and bubbly, white head. Not bad retention, as it slowly faded over the course of a minute or so.		SMELL: Pine and floral aromas dominate the smell, but mild malt and grapefruit smells are present as well.		TASTE: This is a hoppy, bitter beer and it is delicious. The hops dominate from start to finish in this beer and balance is a relative term in this case, however, there are enough grapefruit and floral flavors to ensure that the hops don't completely destroy the palate. Very dry all the way through, particularly in the aftertaste. 		MOUTHFEEL: Well carbonated, the Caldera sparkles from start to finish while it dries and bitters the whole way through. 		DRINKABILITY: This is what a West Coast IPA is supposed to be all about - bold, bitter and biting. This is not a beginner beer, it is for the seasoned hop head who can appreciate every IBU packed into this brew.

review/text: 12oz can received as a great extra in a trade with jpmclaug. Thanks Jason! Poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.		A - Pours a clear, dark orangey amber color with a fluffy finger of cream colored foam. Head has veyr good stying power and after descending, leaves behind thick streaks of lacing.		S - Lots of pine up front mixed with some pineapple, mango and grapefruit. Lightly caramalized malt presence...other than that, almost entirely hops in the nose.		T - Tight, crisp hop bitterness. Piney hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus component. Stronger malt base than the aroma indicates with lots of breadiness and toasted malt. Very nicely balanced overall.		M - Light/medium bodied with a crisp and tingly medium/medium-high carbonation level. Estery fruitiness mixed with a clean hop bitterness linger past the swallow. A bit sticky and resiny from the hops.		D - A really good IPA. Well brewed with excellent balance and multilayered flavors. Could easy stick with this one throughout a session. Tasty brew without being over the top...on the high end of sessionable strength, but a few of these shouldn't kill me either.

Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol.	M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body.

review/text: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.

review/text: Poured from a 12 oz can to a pint glass.		A - Deep Amber color with a healthy head and most decent retention. Thick spotted lacing climbing down various sides of the glass.		S - A large upfront hit of citrus with some pine notes hiding behind some sweet caramel malt essence.		T - Right of the bat, a major hit of citrus with a follow up of some semi-sweet flavor (pineapple). Mildly sweet malty transition to the finish with a late note of Piney Hop(s) and lemon.		M - Nice body, slightly above average in carbonation, but seems to be missing a little in the transition from introduction to finishing edge, I suppose the "carryover."		D - By far the best canned IPA I've had to date, especially for the price. Certainly drinkable and pretty hoppy. I like the start and finish but was left wanting just a little more in the middle. Overall a pretty decent beer and easy to enjoy as a "session" beer.		My prescription: Get it if you can and try a few. It runs with the common theme of West Coast IPA's though IMHO it's just slightly weaker in overall flavors and finish.

review/text: First had: on tap at Concordia Ale House, Portland, OR		Poured into a 12oz. glass, a dark brown-black with a thin tan head. I don't like coconut anything really, but the wife does, and she got this beer, so I'm glad I ended up sampling it because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Smelled of--you guessed it--coconut, and milk chocolate, with some smooth roasted malts in the background. Very smooth on the tongue, taste of dark malts, and chocolate coated macaroons....which again, I do not like, but in beer form it translated so well. Sweet, but not overbearingly so, and then slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was smooth, but not quite full-bodied; it was definitely a porter and not a stout. Very good overall.

review/text: Orange color for a beer with orange in the name. Minimal head, its all good. Definite citrus (orange?) hop impressions here. Pleasant.		Dry taste, moderate bitterness, full hop mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Not overpowering hop presence, but good nonetheless, gives it the delicate and on point treatment moreso than just simplistic bitter brutality. Crystal and caramel malt seem to be kicking it here. Stayed away from sweet territory. Definitely gets its orange name from the hop impressions, not the addition of fruit.

review/text: This was at the newer Caldera Tap House in Ashland (Rogue Brewery's old, original spot....) It was a little dark on the patio outside, but it certainly had an orange glow and appropriate lacing. Aroma had lavender, clementine, grapefruit pith, scented geranium and thai basil exploding from the glass. Delightfully potent hops without the poison-like bitterness or tannin. Don't get me wrong, I like big beers, but drinkability for a pitcher with friends is crucial and this fit the bill.

review/text: I had the opportunity to try this wonderful beer on tap at the Rogue Brewery sponsored Bones and Brew Backyard BBQ this weekend in Portland, Oregon's Pearl District. Thirty delicious beers on tap and this was the first I tried (hey, I'm a Southern Oregon man, plus my girlfriend wanted something a little fruity). The orange flavor was vibrant and quite simply amazing. Sweet, but not too sweet, and not overly bitter. The hops and orange flavor played very well together. I would love to try it once again, if I can find it.

review/text: Tried this beer recently on-tap at Tugboat Brewing in Portland, a pint glass at Happy Hour - May 1, 2007. Pretty sure I've had this before...		Here's the description from Caldera's website for this year-round offering:	"A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon; Original gravity: 1.052; Alcohol by volume: 5.4%."		A: Beautiful, slightly hazy honey-orange color. Light to moderate fast-rising carbonation. Topped with a creamy, off-white head, about 1-1/2 fingers, gently fading. Good lace.		S: Malty caramel, a touch sweet. A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. 		T: More toffee-maltiness than I'd expected, but offset with that 'orange' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall.		M: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue. This analogy may sound weird, but it felt like a quarter was being pressed down on my tongue...		D: For a beer without a definitive style to grade against, I can really just say that - yes - it was enjoyable and - yes - I would get it again.

review/text: On tap tonight at the Horse Brass.	Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left.	Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest.	The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout.	Mouthfeel was rather on the thin side and average for style	This is a nice beer but for once I think this would be better served quite chilled.

review/text: I'm guessing a bit with the style on this one. I suspect it is intended as a fruit beer. The orange in the name is certainly reflected in the taste and nose as well as the colour.		I found this on-tap at Kelly's Olympian and certainly hasn't been there for more than a fortnight.		This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice.		It is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for such a dry beer. Not frou-frou.

review/text: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. 		The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. 		The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. 		Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. 		Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.

review/text: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. 		Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.

review/text: Okay, pilseners aren't that hard to make, but being able to match what I drank in Germany? Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be. Overall, an exceptional beer!

review/text: Again folks, I do enjoy a fruit beer every now and then, and this was a pretty decent brew, just not a stand out.		A - pours an average reddish gold hue with light carbonation and a thin head		S - Actually nice on the nose, delicate perfume with ginger, honey, and flowers up front.		T - Pretty good, though nothing special, kind of girly, but would be nice to drink at the pool or beach		M - light bodied and lacks stuffing, lots of acidity up front		D - gets rather boring and a little too tedious after the first few sips.

review/text: Pour from draught into an imperial pint at the Horse Brass, Exotic Erotic Passion Fruit Ale is a clear gold, with a thin white head and no lace. 		The smell is mild and fruity, as much from the dry hopped cascade(?) as the passion fruit it seems. Not bad, but more restrained then I expected.		The taste is bitter sweet, a little grainy, not much hops and a touch of passionfruit. Basically drinks like a pale ale, not as fruity or tart as I was expecting. While I didn't want a daiquiri, I could have used more of the "real passion fruit puree" that this was made with. 		The mouthfeel was quite nice, creamy and very light without being watery. 		This was pretty drinkable, mainly due to the light body and borderline bland taste. I, however, like my beers have to some punch to them taste wise, and didn't find that here.

review/text: 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass		A: Pours hazy dark red-orange with just over a finger of fairly tight white head. Good retention, leaves decent lacing.		S: Pine, candied fruit, caramel. Very sweet smelling, this one could be fading.		T: Hops are definitely on the down swing. Upfront I get pine, slightly dank orange and herbs, a little grapefruit, and floral notes. Not too bitter or sharp. There definitely is a good bit of caramel sweetness, but it isn't so much so that it's offensive. Fairly wet finish with a little bit of lingering bitterness. 		M: Medium body, moderate carbonation that fizzes out quickly and leaves a smooth and nearly effervescent-free finish. Fairly resinous and an adequate level of bitterness.		O: This actually isn't too bad for a now fading IPA. I could see this being pretty solid when fresh, maybe even great. At this point now it doesn't seem that old (maybe 2 months to 3 months) and is certainly enjoyable.

review/text: A: An attractive orangish amber in color, clear. Finger of off-white/tan head with nice texture. Good amount of lacing and film with lots of large bubbles. Unfortunately, this is the highlight of the beer.		S: Hops are here, but they're in the backseat of the smell. Caramel and nutty with pine and grass hops. It's not a bad smell at all, but not what I'm looking for in my IPAs really.		T: Caramel, nutty, bread crust, sugary with piney, resinous hops playing a larger role in the taste. Has a tea like quality.		M: Medium to full bodied. Dry, sticky and bitter at the finish lets you know Caldera added plenty of hops to the beer...I'm just not sure why they didn't play a larger role in the smell. Oh well.		O: This by no means is a bad beer and is ejoyable, but I can't see myself paying the Oregon premium for this beer again. It's just not quite what I want from the style.

Wrong at death a killer long lasting bitter hit on the back of the tounge. The finish lasts forever. Overall not a killer IPA, but certinly a very tasty drinkable brew that's a lot different than Caldera IPA. I like it, worth a try, if you like IPA's.

review/text: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing.		Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad.		Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry.		Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated.		Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.

review/text: Bomber poured into a Duvel tulip. No dating on the bottle or label. Clear, amber body with red highlights. Darker than I would have expected for an IPA. One-finger tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves a smattering of lacing around the glass.		The first aroma is definitely from the hops - piney and grassy. But, the predominant aroma as I go down the glass is the malt. Definite predominant caramel and maple malt aroma.		Well, I'm a little disappointed in the flavor. The hops are definitely taking a back seat to the malt. No doubt, there are hops in the blend, but the malt is more forward, so it does follow the aroma fairly closely.		The mouthfeel is of a medium thickness. Of course, with no dating, this bottle could be older with faded hops, but I'll never know. Average IPA at best.

review/text: This one is eclipsed by the regular Caldera IPA that comes in a can unfortunately... I was looking for a more pronounced citrus bitterness and this was more floral and fragrant in nature... A different animal altogether and this somehow missed the mark for me... A fairly average brew with just a nint of hops to it and this bottle should be pretty fresh... This wasn't bad, mind you, but it just tasted and felt rather run of the mill to me...

review/text: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.

review/text: Pours a brilliant ruby with a 1-finger offwhite head. Solid ring of retention and moderate lace.		With obvious nods from the ruby color, this has a much more roasty character to the malt- toasted grain and apricot aromas- while the bigtime hops add a lot of floral, grapefruity tones as well as a faint touch of cheesy pungency. Unfortunately, with the darker roast on the malt making a bigger overall impression on the aroma profile, the beer seems to be having an identity crisis- losing complexity in the process.		The palate mostly mirrors the nose, with the bigger malt character bumping elbows with the hoppiness. Starts medium bodied and creamy, with an instant blast of hop bitterness- flavors of apricot, toasted grain and red grapefruit- while the toastiness and bitterness roll right on through the finish.		If there's such a style as a Red IPA, then maybe this clears the bar. But as a standard IPA, this completely misses for me. Plainly stated, IPAs should scream hops, and I really don't like it when the malt tries to turn it into a screaming match. That extra roastiness just overpowered any sort of subtlty to the drink.

review/text: 650 mL bottle poured into a pint glass.		Appearance - Purs a murky amber with a sizable head. Lacing is minimal once the head dissipates. Doesn't look bad.		Smell - Some citrus hops. Not overwhelming. There's a background smell that reminds me of homebrew. Like a musty smell.		Taste - Taste is initially hoppy, but not all that hoppy. Behind that is a nutty maltiness, maybe with a hint of spiciness. Finally, however, is an awful grassy bitterness that renders the beer just about undrinkable. It coats the mouth and doesn't go away.		Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. After the hops and malt it dries out quickly, leaving the bitterness just hanging. It emphasizes the awful flavor.		Overall - The first half of the flavor is decent, but the finish is very bad. My brother-in-law and I both drainpoured our glasses once I finished the review.

review/text: Attractive amber in the tulip glass with very nice head and lacing. Modest aroma. Initial taste is promising. A touch of sweet malt but mostly it's the heavy hand of hops. Sharp and acidic on the palate. Some aromatics with a flowery touch, but mostly just bitter. Aftertaste goes on and on. Unrelieved bitterness with not much interest to go with it.		Not very drinkable. I am trying to find something good to say about this beer, since it's clean and well made. But for IPA lovers, it's definitely in the zone.

review/text: Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.		A: Clear, light reddish-amber color with one finger of lofty off-white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.		S: A faint combination of floral and piney hops that also feature some toast and mixed fruit.		T: Begins off-dry, with malt-focused flavors of toasted bread and caramel that increase in sweetness. Hop aromatics are floral but muted. Astringency emerges in the middle as acidity peaks at a moderate level. The finish possesses diminishing qualities encountered earlier, mainly floral hops and esters, with moderate bitterness.		M: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation.		D: If a brewery that cans most of their product puts a beer in a bottle, does that mean it's special? In this case, the answer is no. It is a very malt-focused IPA that features an underwhelming smell and some rough flavor edges. Ultimately Caldera's standard IPA wins out, with this beer as a hybrid IPA/DIPA that just lacks characteristic abv and hop intensity. This mis-step does little to shake my confidence in Caldera, considering the mastery shown in other beers such as the barrel-aged Mogli or their rauch bock. I do have to question the source of their interest in this particular recipe.

review/text: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.

The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a "one and done" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.

review/text: Appearance - This is a dark malty brownish-bronze in color with a good, off-white head that pitted well.		Smell - The pine and citrus here is very tight and wrapped in a malty toasted base. The hops are very raw and fresh.		Taste - The malt gets bigger at the taste but the hops are still, well, hopping. The malt adds some sweetness here, maybe caramel, and the pine actually seems bigger as well which is the exact opposite of most every other AIPA.		Mouthfeel - This is medium-bodied with some bitterness but nothing heavy. The carbs are very light but well done.		Drinkability - This is a quality but uneventful drink. You won't impress anyone by serving this but you won't disappoint.

review/text: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.

review/text: zoso 1967, thanks again for a new treat. BuckyFresh, thanks for drinking said treat with me. Review is from notes on 10/16/10.		A: Pours a dark gold, bordering on amber with a tint of orange into a snifter. A half finger khaki head vanishes quickly, leaving a washboard film pattern on top. Thin, straight lines of carbonation move slowly up the glass. Small dotty lacing with a couple of arches is moderately sticky. 		S: I am not sure when this was bottled, but caramel malts are edging out the Centennial hops in my nose. Sweeter citrus notes of orange and lime and a dry, bitter hop character exist in the background. A hint of spiciness is also evident. 		T: The malt to hop balance is better than I thought it would be. Caramel malts are the dominant flavor, but citrus hops and nice dry pine and grassy hoppiness on the finish provide a counterpoint to the malts. 		M: This is a solid medium feel for an IPA with a coating sensation from the copious malt presence. The finish is a drying hop suck on the sides of my palate. 		D: HK is not my ideal IPA with the citrus hop notes a bit of an afterthought in the taste, but it is still pretty tasty. I do not think I would seek this out again, but I did enjoy drinking it. Oh yeah, the label is amazing. I love the little hop men knocking on the door to the cosmos - classic.

review/text: Appears dark amber/ red with an inch and a half of off color whit head.		It smells citrus. It also smells strongly of caramel. There is a bit of a grassy hop smell as well.		It tastes much like the smell. It initially tastes strongly of orange and other citrus fruits. An earthy slightly floral hop flavor is also present. A substantial amount of caramel sweetness balances the beer. A bitter aftertaste is present. This is a pretty generic tasting DIPA.		The carbonation is moderate low.		The drinkability is ok. I can finish this bottle easily but the heavy caramel malt quality of this beer would limit how much of the beer I would want to drink. 		Overall this is a pretty good beer. But there really is nothing about it. It is an average example of the DIPA. It is enjoyable but it seems uninspired.

review/text: Enjoyed with TCHopCraver. Thanks to zoso1967 for supplying this tasty brew!		Appearance: Split two ways and poured into a large snifter. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange with a small head that recedes pretty quickly. A small ring of lacing made of large bubbles is left after the head recedes. Some scattered streams of carbonation are visible in the glass.		Smell: I was expecting more in the way of hop aroma, but the bottle did sit a while, so perhaps that has something to do with it. There is some fairly decent citrus and pine notes, as well as some grainy malt aroma and a bit of something musty in the background. There is also a touch of spice present; almost reminiscent of a saison-type influence.		Taste: There is definitely more bitterness than the smell leads on. The flavor is pretty well balanced with a decent malt profile. There's not a ton of complexity here, but it is a pretty decent representation of the style.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy texture, with some biting pine notes. Fairly dry finish, and there's definitely some lingering bitterness there.		Drinkability: Pretty easy drinker, but a little more on the malty side than your typical IPA. Definitely enjoyable though; I'd certainly reach for another.

review/text: Like someone else has written this almost looked like a barleywine. A nice copper, slightly darker than I'd expect, a little thin head that leaves some lacing.		Initially after the pour I took in whiffs of pine, and citrus, but after letting it settle I got more biscuit and sweet malts.		Tastes like it smelled, initial hop blast that singes the tongue, then it subsides to give a biscuit/malt based finish. Overall, I'd say it tasted like a hoppy barleywine.		Mouthfeel is medium to light, a bit of carbonation, but overall good.		at 7% more or less, it's a decent offering

review/text: A pretty orange and auburn color scheme going on, head was very doughy with good retention. Aroma was hoppy to a degree, but wasn't anything to write home about. The appearance was like a 4.25 and the aroma 3.75, so it all evens out.		Intense bitterness when you drink this. Seemed to be chinook, cascade and centennial combo, maybe with some willamette's thrown in for good measure. At times the bitterness just overshadows anything going on. Really, I can't see this being worth delving into the bottle world, it doesn't add anything that I can't get in the can for an ipa. Would have to lean on grapefruit the most to describe the hop and bitterness feel (moreso) in this beer.		Comes off a little more like a PacNW ipa than west coast. A degree of wood, not super piney hops. 		This was my first Caldera brew that was not in a can.

review/text: Very cloudy dark orange body is opaque. Two fingers of slighty rocky, mostly level white foam.		Very piney aroma, with a bit of biscuit and a faint whiff of cleanser.		Big swath of sweetness splatters across the tongue. Mix of hop tastes follows - grapefruit citrus, earthy, pine. 		Medium plus mouthfeel. Ok drinkability.		An ok but unexceptional IPA or IIPA. No date to be found, so unless I encounter one I know to be very fresh, I won't be revisiting.

review/text: Appearance: (4.0)	- Pours a dark clear copper. Looks much like an amber ale. Couple fingers of fluffy white foam.. settles to a large fluffy ring of lace, and thin pillow on top. 		Smell: (3.5)	- Big grassy spicy earthy hops. Caramel malt background. Smells very herbal and bready. Lightly sweet. Lots of caramel malts here. Slight citrus touch to the hops. 		Taste: (3.5)	- Big piney and grassy hops. Quite a bitter brew with sweet caramel and a bready/biscuit backing. Overall spicy, earthy, and grassy. Not really a lot of either floral, or citrus hops here. Roasty brown sugars. 		Mouth Feel: (3.0)	- Surprisingly lighter bodied than I had expected. Just sitting under medium bodied, and has plenty of carbonation. Very dry and cloying, but not at all chewy. A tad thin.		Overall: (3.5)	- This is more a bitter bomb of an amber ale. Light caramel backing, and huge bitter grassy hops. That's about it. I feel like it is missing quite a bit, and is a little one-dimensional. Worth the try if you like really dry bitter beers. Otherwise there are better on the shelf for the money.

review/text: Thanks to Patrick (Jctribe25) for brining this bottle back from Cali for me. Thanks man.		Good looking beer. Thick, creamy head that rises well above the glass and has a great deal of structure. It eventually collapse upon itself but leave a sheet of thick lacing in the glass. The beer is a deep dull amber color with a light haze. No visible carbonation. Some orange tones in the color.		Aroma is more toasted malt focused with some slight citrus notes in the background. This is certainly starting off more like a Northwest IPA vs. a "West Coast" Ipa.		Focuses more on balance vs. a hop blast. Fairly sweet and a lot of toasted malt. The bitterness is early then lingers late with some sweetness and fruit mid palate.	What's interesting is that this taste likes a freshly drawn ale. As noted above, this is a classically Oregon IPA. The aftertaste is an interesting combination of dark, crispy bread crust and a bit of grapefruit peel.		Fairly bold on the mouth and with a thick body. Light carbonation and almost oily on the tongue.		A touch too sweet for me, but still a decent IPA. Glad I had the Hopportunity. (sorry)		Thanks Patrick!

review/text: 22oz bottle into a perfect pint. 		A - Hazy auburn, pours with a huge pillowy three fingers of head with nice retention. Rings of lacing down the glass. Very nice looking.		S - Not as hoppy as the illustration on the label might lead you to believe. And ugh, it has a vegetative quality to it that just does not work at all for me, almost like leafy greens. Some sweet malts also lurking around the edges. 		T - Luckily not very similar to the nose. It's definitely on the sweeter side of IPAs, with plenty of bitterness from the hops but not a lot of the flavor that I've some to expect. It's okay but nothing spectacular, just very average. Not much in the way of detectable alcohol. 		M - Thick and full-bodied. Long dry finish. Definitely one of the best aspects of the beer. 		D - ABV isn't too high, but the aroma and taste just aren't doing it for me. I doubt I'd reach for another. 		O - Very much a mixed bag, with some great attributes -- look and feel -- and some bad ones. Unfortunately this beer fails for me on the keys -- smell and taste. I know Caldera can do better.

review/text: 22 picked up yesterday at the COOP.. Poured into my Old Guardian goblet.... pretty deep cloudy orange verging on amber.. nice enough 1 finger off white head has pretty good retention and lacing.		Nose is pithy grapefruit hops and some back ground floral hoppiness... the pale malts are pretty prevalent.. so is some toasty malts.		Pretty big up front.. bitter and bracing citrus hops move slowly but surely into pale malts that push the grapefruit back out into the middle... the toasted malts show toward the finish and combine with the biting hops... grassy floral elements show with warmth.		Body (and hops) verge on DIPA territory... carbonation is good but it doesn't scrape away the toasty malts that I find a bit distracting.		Good.. but not great.... 		3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5

review/text: Into a standard pint. Picked up from K&L Wines in Hollywood.		Slightly golden, amber body with an off white two finger rocky head. Good lacing and head retention.		A clean piney hop fragrance dominates the nose. Also some floral notes, a slight grapefruit citrus scent, and a caramel like sweetness.		The taste is of toasty caramel malts, some bread, a bit of butterscotch, bitter tobacco resin, minty pine, and a slight dash of grapefruit citrus. The flavors just don't seem to come together very well though.		Fairly hefty body, not much carbonation, bitter finish, but not really dry. A nice creaminess though.		An east coast style IPA from an Oregon brewery. Pretty solid, but not really my favorite kind of IPA.

review/text: From bomber to pint glass 08/10/10		A: Pours a deep orange-copper with a 1 inch, mocha-colored head. Appears quite oily and dense for the style and the carbonation looks like it's struggling to escape. Lots of foamy lacing.		S: Citrusy grapefruit aroma and lots of pine. There is a faint sweetness in the backdrop, but the overall nose seems a little dampened.		T: Bitter, grapefruity hops crash the palate, balanced by a touch of bready, slightly sweet malts. The hops are powerful here but they work well against the honey sweetness. There's some orange and lemon zest in there, and the alcohol has a warming effect halfway through each sip. As the beer warms, grassy, earthy, almost floral flavors can be detected. The beer finishes pleasantly bitter and dry.		M: This is a fairly rich, chewy beer and could pass for a DIPA in its texture. The carbonation is perfect for this style and nicely washes away each sip. The taste is much more vibrant than the nose, and I wonder if that's due in part to its oily, full-bodied composition.		D: This is a total hop-bomb, but as your palate adjusts to the aggressively bitter hop profile you'll find this brew quite balanced. I noticed myself drinking faster as I was writing this review.		Notes: Overall, quite impressive. This could easily pass for a California IPA and could stand up against some of the better known hop monsters coming out of SoCal. I'm really particular about IPA's and fairly skeptical about unknown renditions, but after finishing a pint I'm surprising satisfied.This is the first offering I've sampled from Caldera and they've passed my IPA test with flying colors, so they'll be on my radar.

review/text: 22oz bottle shared on the review date		Being a huge of Caldera IPA, I had great expectations of this one.		Hazy amber with a thin eggshell head. Mild lacing left gossamer strands clinging to the sides of the glass.		Loads of sweet toffee malt and some big piney hops in the nose. Slightly out of balance with a bit much malt.		Initial toasted malt blooms into an explosion of biscuit in the middle, with a big hops bittereness at the end. Bitter for the sake of bitter. Doesn't bring any of the pleasant citrus, piney, grassy hop flavors, just bitterness.		Medium light mouthfeel, finishes very quickly. Drinkability is just average. Didn't enjoy this one as much as Caldera IPA.

S- Sweet, sugar-coated floral hops, some pine resin. 		T- Impressively bitter. Dry hopped? Intense hop flavors, piny/earthy combo. Great lingering finish. 		M- Healthy carbonation, great finish, nice heft to the beer. Not too sweet, lasting bitterness is welcome.		D- Fairly high... lots of hops in this one. I'm lovin' it. Worth seeking out.

review/text: Big thanks to G311 for this one.		A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace.		S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so.		T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional.		M - IPA. A little flaccid.		D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.

review/text: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. 		S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well.		T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance.		M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish.		D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.

review/text: Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Kind of a creepy label with big hop cones banging down your door out in space...		SAE/ECE Amber liquid, not quite clear with brighter amber highlights. A pale buff/cream crown of soft peaks recedes to a lasting finger, leaving behind crazed webs of fine sticky lacing.		Brewed with 100% Centennial hops at all stages and this shows - the signature C-hop bitterness is hinted at in the aromatics along with a blast of citrus, spicy evergreen, and floral scents. 		The palate is likewise suffused with whole-cone dank hemp-y goodness with hints of orange zest, grapefruit, and an almost cedar-like woody/earthy element that is at least as much a contribution of the hardy (hearty?) malt backbone as it is derived from the hops - an unapologetically NW-style IPA, malt forward with a suggestion of wet stones and cocoa in the bitter, fruity finish. 		Medium-full bodied, oily, almost sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a touch of warmth from the alcohol. 		Some astringency in the finish makes it a sipper, and overall I think it does better with food (grilled salmon comes immediately to mind) than all on its lonesome.		Not as well balanced as their regular canned IPA, but that isn't the point of this series.

review/text: On tap at Horse Brass, 7.9.2010, $4.75 imperial pint.		One finger creamy white head, medium-fast dissipation with some lacing. Reddish amber clear body, no visible carbonation. The nose is spicy, piny hops and caramel malts, battling for attention, nicely balanced. Taste is a bit of malty sweetness upfront, firm malt backbone in the middle, and a lingering fairly bitter resiny hop finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full, not much effervescence, fairly dry, resiny and a bit sticky. There is some pretty serious hoppiness in play here, not overly bitter. Looking forward to comparing this with the bottled version.

review/text: this is my first Caldera brew have seen cans of pale ale and ipa before. Upon pouring this ipa i saw a hazy amber beer with a thick dull white head and smelled hops. A goodstart to an ipa. The smell is of citrus-grapefruit, earthy, and a hint of pine. The taste is pungent grapefruit, battling pine, and subtle sweet malt flavor. Not the most complex beer but all the same good.

review/text: 22oz bottle.		Pours dark copper with an inch-plus head of biege. Plenty of webbed lacing and a solid skim coat on the surface for the duration of the glass. 		Aromatics are laced with dank tangerine, pine, caramel, and grapefruit. Somewhat pungent. Sweet malt follows through.		Medium bodied with a slightly chewy, tacky mouthfeel. A bit grippy.		Plump malt and pithy tangerine lead off the palate. Pine-rubbed grapefruit and a firm bitterness step forward. Plenty of dank, herbaceous resins. Almost woodsy.		Finishes with a lingering, drying bitterness that balances the sweet malt and plenty of chewy resins.		Tasty one. On the malty side of IPA's, and the nose could be ramped up, but plenty of dankness and pine dew to go around.

review/text: Appearance - Pours a cloudy dark tangerine color with about a finger of tan head that quickly dissipates leaving slight lacing.		Smell - The nose is of heavy caramel and malt, slightly bitter grapefruit, hops, other citrus such as orange peel, and slight piney and floral scents.		Taste - More balanced than I would have thought. A hoppy citrus burst up front that becomes more bitter the more you drink the beer as it warms. This is then oddly encapsulated by a heavy malty, caramel backbone. So I guess the overall product in sum is balanced but in reality as this beer warms up there are two extremes to it.		Mouthfeel - Moderate body, oily slick hops, medium carbonation.		Drinkability - I'll put this in the "somewhat" category. Knowing I have a Blind Pig waiting for me after this makes me realize that this is not as drinkable as one would expect. Now, give me 10 Blind Pigs in a row and I will still ask for more. They are right around the same ABV but this beer just doesn't leave me craving more of it. Not bad, but nothing spectacular to be honest.

review/text: 22 oz. bottle,		A: Pours amber with a good frothy white head, good lace, nice looking IPA.		S: Classic Centennial, northwest hop nose. Grapefruit, tangerine, assorted citrus, with a hint of pine and malt.		T: On the maltier side, this is definitely not San Diego. Strong pink grapefruit, cantaloupe rind, with the strong crystal malt flavour, bordering on amber ale.		M: Fairly light-bodied in this style, soft carbonation, moderate aftertaste.		D: A solid IPA, reminded me a lot of Ranger or Union Jack in the hop flavours. Not my favourite hop tastes, but a well made beer I'm happy to drink.

review/text: A 22 ounce bomber bottle picked up at Abe's for $5 and change. Uncapped and poured into my Imperial nonic pint glass. Appears a crystal clear deep copper color with a good inch of sticky off white foam. The head leaves a thick lace in its wake. Nose and flavors are of caramel malt, white and red grapefruit peel, pith, and juice, plenty of floral notes, some other citrus such as orange and lemon, a good amount of bitterness here. Medium in both body and carbonation with a lingering bitter finish. Fans of Centennial hops should check this one out.

review/text: This beer pours a wonderful copper amber with only a slight white head and decent lacing. The aroma is very complex with plenty of pine and citrus hops, but also some toasty roasty malt character that is not overpowering and quite nice. The flavor follows the same path. Very bitter with a huge citrus and pine punch to the taste buds, as well as a groin kick of roasted and caramel malt. I have to say, I thought this was just a normal IPA, but it seems to be leaning a bit more towards an American strong ale/Black IPA in flavor. Astringency and bitterness fight a battle royal in my mouth, and I am lucky enough to have a front row seat. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and has one of those sticky/dry finishes that are common in beers of this gravity and hop load. Not the most drinkable for style, but still goes down pretty easily. I really like this, and am glad it comes in a bomber.

review/text: Bomber (with a cool label) poured into my large Gulden Draak tulip, Hopportunity Knocks is orangish pale amber with a huge light sand head that is very tight and creamy, slow to subside, leaving big chunks of foamy lace. Very nice head, but the body's a bit dark and murky for an IPA. 		Smell is skunky, some citrus, earthy spice too. Nice floral sweetness, but not the blistering hops I expected from the label. 		Taste is pretty citrusy, spicy hops, but not to strong. Big bready malt backbone, moderate bitterness, definitely on the malty side or an IPA, more like a hoppy amber or pale ale. Marketed as such, I'd have scored it higher. I don't really like big malty IPAs. 		Mouthfeel is slick and oily, there's a thinness to this, almost cask like, in spite of the chewiness of the malt. 		Drinkability is okay, but with a name like Hopportunity Knocks, I was expecting a much hoppier brew. This one is a new release and I bought it from a cooler so I'm sure it's pretty fresh. OK but not special.

review/text: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. 	Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. 		It's a good beer but not outstanding.

review/text: A: Dark amber with a slight hint of red.		S: Lots of citrus, but it's kind of weak.		T: Good hop flavor, pretty bitter. You get an immediate citrus flavor followed quickly by the bitterness.		M: Medium body, a little too bitter and malty on the aftertaste for me. Much prefer their IPA in a can.		D: Moderate drinkability, I had the bomber myself, and didn't want another one.		I too was excited to see a Caldera in a bottle, but after tasting it I much prefer their IPA or Pale Ale in a can.

review/text: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts.	The label describes "centennial hops" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the "State of Jefferson" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!

review/text: The hopportunity knocks poured a copper color with a 2-3 finger foam head with decent retention. 		The nose is high on citrus since on the bottle it mentions solely Centennial. You also get a little sweetness. Solid malt backbone with a moderate bitterness. Not over the top but manageable. In the mouth it tickles the roof of the mouth and leaves a mark on tongue. Overall a good offering in a bottle from the boys down south.

review/text: What's this? Caldera brew in a bottle! Who knew?! I thought they were strictly about the can, but I stand corrected.		The pour is a nice copper color with a thin layer of head that vanishes quickly, and the lacing is minimal. Citrus hops along side mild malts on the nose. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice amount of carb. The flavor is good and hoppy; nice and bitter! This is not a beginner's ale, so if you are new to the micro game, this may not be the beer for you. Since this is a Caldera brew, it could EASILY pass for an IPA. Overall drinkability is great. I really like this and could easily sit down with a few of these on a weekend with friends and a barbeque.

review/text: On tap at Concordia Alehouse in Portland, OR. For the record, this was not billed as the Old Growth on the beer list.		I have a new entry on my very favorite Imperial Stouts list. What a dandy brew!		I've never quaffed a stout quite like this one. Huge chocolate/spice aroma, nice creamy medium-full body with moderate carbonation and little lace left on the pint glass. Fabulous roasty, sweet, chocolate, spice (cinnamon, nutmeg?) taste that just hits the spot. Not particularly hoppy, but an adequate bite from the alcohol, roast barley/black patent/spice. A great balance of flavors that is complex, yet seamless. I really can't quite do this beer justice in a review, so why doesn't everybody go blow all the kegs of this stuff in Oregon and convince Caldera to ramp up the production?

review/text: Had this on tap at Horse Brass. It arrived at the same time as my wife's Guinness and our friend's Black Butte. The similarity in the beers visibly was uncanny. It was a solid opaque black graced with a regal quaff of foam.		The aroma was tart and slightly smokey. Mild, but partly due to the competition with the fancy pipe smoke from the guy sitting next to us.		The taste was astounding. Its rare that you stumble across something that can easily replace a standard with such ease. Nothing in this beer is overstated, but the smooth combination of dry, tart and peat, with a slight fruitiness in just the right amount for a sweet compliment.		This is a stellar seasonal, and I hope they keep the recipe. I would not change a single thing. There seems to be confusion over what this beer is. Caldera's "site" says that it changes by season. This years seems to be somewhere between a tart stout and a old brown.

review/text: A can picked up in Baltimore.		Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.

review/text: I assume this is fairly fresh as it is the first time I have seen it at my favorite beer store. Pours clear amber with a one finger white head. Fair lacings. Aroma is very hoppy for the style. Taste is quite hoppy earthy slight citrus and a firm but not overly sweet backbone. Medium dry mildly bitter finish. A bit astringent on the palate. Not sweet and cloying like most American Ambers. I think this is a bit on the bitter side for the style. Which would make it closer to a PA which I like very much. So for my tastes this is fine. If you enjoy your ambers on the sweeter side you better pass on this beer.

review/text: Saw the colorful can on the store shelves and realized it wasn't Caldera Pale! Amber is finally in a can! 		pours a rich, orange tinged textbook amber hue, crystal clear with a thick, light tannish-orange two-finger head that has impressive retention and leaves behind just a bit of lacing. more lacing and this one would be perfect. 		aroma is a fairly potent yet straight forward mix of malts, a hint of caramel, and green, herbal, and pine hop notes. Simple, yet effective. 		Taste follows suit in its simplicity and effectiveness. Clean, with a decent malt backbone gives it a hint of caramel sweetness, flanked by some fairly hoppy notes. hints of vegetable and green herbal notes are present along with a bit of black tea. A good bitter kick from the galena hops in the finish.		Mouthfeel is clean, well carbonated, medium body, and all around a solid example of an amber. nothing outstanding, but can't find any fault. 		All in all, I'm stoked to see Caldera Amber in a can, which definitely helps the drinkability score. on their website, they say "Simplicity is the key to this recipe." Sounds about right. nothing earth-shattering, but definitely a solid amber that I could drink a few of in a row. Enough hop and malt character to push it past most generic ambers, this one is a definite winner in my book.

review/text: Served in dining room of Crater Lake Lodge, Crater Lake National Park, OR, in 12 ounce pilsner glass.		Dark amber color with one finger head.		Initial hop aroma pronounced.		Slight lemon tang gave way to pronounced hop finish.		Very drinkable, would make a good session beer.		A pity I was not able to try CBC's IPA this trip. As good as the Amber was, the IPA would have been outstanding.

Flavors are similar to that of brewed tea, with some malt sweetness and creaminess. The finish is crisp and a tad bitter from the hops.		Mouthfeel is pretty good, a nicely carbonated beer.		Very session worthy amber. Nothing special, but it's simple and tasty.

review/text: I seem to have had better luck than RedDiamond with Caldera's beers. Luckily, I've never had a contaminated beer from Caldera. (Might the problem be the tap lines at the Creek? I've never had trouble with Caldera at the Black Sheep...)		Pours a clear and light amber, with one finger of off-white, moderately lingering head.		Solid, fresh aroma of pine and citrus hops.		The beer has a quite fresh citrus hop flavor, backed by surprisingly moderate bitterness and balanced by a big, caramely and slightly bready maltiness. Otherwise clean, with few esters. Presents a medium-light body for a pleasant and appropriate mouthfeel. A well-balanced beer with excellent fresh hop flavor, making for a good session beer. Overall, a solid amber.

review/text: As with Calderas Oatmeal Stout, I relied upon a visit to the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill to make my appraisal of their amber and was disappointed in being served a spoiled beer. Its quite frustrating to travel 600 miles round-trip to sample a beer as close to the source as possible, only to get a bad pour. Am I the victim of an arbitrary occurrence or a systematic glitch? Cant say. But readers may check out my review/rant for Calderas Oatmeal Stout to learn why I hold the brewery at least partly responsible for the quality of their beers as dispensed through their hometown accounts. 			Meanwhile, Ill attest that I have reason to believe that Ashland Amber is otherwise a popular local favorite under ideal circumstances. It has a very up-front hop presence for an amber and I imagine that theres a fine brew lurking about somewhere beyond the tainted lines of Ashland Creek. I hope someday to find it.

review/text: P: Pours a rich copper color with a white foamy finger of fast fading head. Not much lacing on sides once swirled, pretty docile. 		N: A sweet malty citrus malt with hints of nuts and floral hops. Maybe some hidden pine lurking in the mix.		T/M: Sweet malt with roasted nuts. Nice addition of floral hops and a dry slightly bitter orange peel finish. Medium body with a touch of tingle on the way down. Comes across much like an IPA.		O: Good mix of bitter and sweet, rolls around the tongue rather nicely. Nice amber for sure one of my favorites thus far. Nice relaxing beer to enjoy. Will revisit soon.

review/text: Grabbed this can at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa.		Pouring into a Firestone Walker nonic pint glass. Mostly clear amber hued with an off-white head that formed a couple fingers thick and retains well. 		Lightly toasted nuttiness with a piney, citrus-rind hop. Slight salted cracker underneath. 		Forward medium to medium-high bitterness with a citrus hop kick. Malt makes itself known, complimenting the hop flavor with toasty/nutty quality. Medium-finish lets the malts linger on in the palette. Dry. 		Medium-light bodied with a moderate-level of carbonation. 		This is one of the better amber ales I've sampled. Excellent toasty/nutty malt pairs excellent with the citrusy hops. Beautifully balanced, one I'd return to again and again.

review/text: Pours a pale amber with a mountain of white, dense, foamy head that has great retention. The nose has faint notes of bready malt, citrusy and pineapple hop aromas, and slight soapiness. The taste is slightly bready malt up front with a mellow citrusy, pineapple-like hop finish. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected, moderately carbonated, but smooth and drinkable.		This is an enjoyable beer, but it's hard to classify as an amber. There are notes of mild IPA all over this. The malt characteristics are typical West Coast IPA as are the hops. Overall, despite the style arguments, it's delicious and enjoyable.

review/text: Poured into an E&J Cask & Cream glass on 9/27/11		Clear, honey-brown amber with a touch of copper. One thumb of puffy foam; it starts to dissipate quickly. Tiny granules of lace follow the beer with each sip; many slide right down the glass.		Smells ok; floral hops and hint of leafy hops are blocked by a strong caramel and doughy bread combo. Hmm; perhaps this isn't the freshest. The flavor profile is set up in a similar manner. There is a decent showing of hops, but they are floral and delicate; bitterness is very low. Perhaps a subtle nip of pine here and there. Solid caramel and bread backdrop, but the hops aren't pushed aside. Around medium body with rolling carbonation. Finishes pretty clean.		This is a pleasant drinking amber ale. I'd like to try it super fresh at some point.

review/text: Possibly the best amber I have tasted in recent memory.		Poured from can into Deschutes becker style pint glass.		Really lovely amber hue with reddish highlights, pure white head leaving a gorgeous lace.		Initially comes off metallic, (after enjoying their pale ale), but second sip doesn't have that issue. Lots of bright fruit, bready yeast and malt notes, hint of English style hops and caramel. Really stunning if not overly complex nose.		Richly flavored with emphasis on the malts. Really nice caramel streak with apple, fig, bread, and nutty notes. Gorgeous.		Texture is wonderful, superb grip and wonderful intensity of flavor. Medium to long finish, great balance. Alcohol is moderate so this is nearly sessionable.		This does what amber ales are supposed to do: be enjoyable, complex, and balanced. Awesome stuff!

review/text: Poured into pint glass		A: Transparent dark amber color, very frothy off white head, leaving tons of lacing and the head receding into a fluffy pillow over the beer.		S: Sweet caramel and bready malt aromas, mixing pretty evenly with citrus fruit and pine hops. Smells very good, but would prefer a little heavier on the hop.		T: Delicious blend of the sweet and bready malt flavors with (mostly) piney hops. Finishes on the dry side with pine flavors lingering.		M/O: Medium body, light-medium carbonation, gets a little creamy in the middle. Insanely drinkable. Definitely a great session beer. I prefer my ambers with a little more hop, but this beer is really good.

review/text: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.

review/text: Poured into a small snifter.		Honey-colored and perfectly clear, topped with a fizzy khaki head that crackles and pops to nothingness after a few seconds. A tiny sticky ring is left behind. 		Sweet nose. Apricot, apple juice, sweet honey-baked biscuits. More sweet than bready. 		The flavor seems at first as if it'll be majorly hoppy, with lots of earthy, spicy bitterness. Fruit soon takes over, however, with honey drizzled apple slices. Its almost like apple or apricot pie, with malt delivering the buttery crust. The slightly drying finish leaves lingering toasted biscuit notes. 		Medium-light body, soft carbonation but moderate fizziness.		Caldera has themselves a very drinkable amber here. It skews to the sweet and fruity, with the bright fruit flavors intriguing and bringing you back for another sip, and just enough hops to balance.

review/text: A: a can of amber liquid that pours to a finger of short lasting head, but does leave a bit of a halo.	S: mostly caramel sweet malt. Then hidden within the sweetness is a nice touch of pine hops.	T: very malty and sweet but has a nice hop background that is mostly piny but not overly bitter. 	M: smooth a touch thick but the carbonation. 	O: I really like this, this could be my everyday brew.

review/text: A can on the late poured into a pint glass. 		A- a stiff pour brings about three good fingers of light tan head that rises above the glass a bit and holds nicely before settling to a thick ring, a thin skin on top, and a few spots of sticky lace. Sunset amber orange in color with a touch of haze to it. 		S- a killer juicy fruity hopping up front and a mildly sweet and bready malt backbone. Simple but great smelling stuff. 		T- light citrus and tropical fruits on top of a well balanced malt profile that brings some light caramel and toasted bread. Super clean finish. 		M- medium body and about the same in carb. Just right for the style. Amazingly thirst quenching and refreshing. 		O- great amber right here. I could kill a sixer of these no problem and I will be as soon as I can. I gota find out how much a case of this is for my next beach run.

review/text: Pours a clear medium yellowish amber. Cream-colored head, slightly orange tint, and ample. Lots of big bubbles that break fast, leaving a thin layer on the surface. Tons of bubbly streams rising up through the glass. Decent lacing.		Smell is mostly hops. I can tell the malts are there, but I don't really pick them up directly. The initial hop hit after the pour is really nice, with a decent amount of citrus and some pine. After that, it fades, leaving mostly light aromatics.		Taste is a good balance, with no flavors really pushing out from the pack. A solid blend of tangy light malts and gentle barely-bitter hops pretty much all the way through. I like the flavor, I just wish it were more persistent. It disappears rather quickly, leaving some grassy hop flavors for a short time before they're gone completely. Very little bitterness anywhere in the taste.		Medium-light in body, carbonation is slightly less than average. Finish is like soft water.		A good, balanced amber ale. No powerful flavors, but the whole comes out really nice. A well-balanced, tasty beer.

review/text: Can. Poured into a tulip glass a fairly clear copper amber color with a 2 finger ligth tan head. The nose has a sweet orange caramel aroma mixed with a slight breadiness. Medium mouthfeel. Starts with a light sweet orange flavor mixed with a some caramel notes. Slight bitterness in the end that lingers for a second. A fairly straight forward amber. Not bad but nothing extraordinary. Some lace left on the glass.

review/text: The appearance isn't bad, the head is a little weak, it is only one half finger in length and isn't sticking around that well, it looks somewhat frothy, but not too creamy. The head is pretty much totally white, where as the body is a standard amber color, there are hughes of orange in here as well, the beer is see through is some areas, but for the most part completely non transparent. it looks ok, nothing special. The smell leads me to think that I'm not going to like the beer, it's all malt on the smell, almost no hops to speak of, and an amber ale should have some hops in there. Not only that, but the malt smells like it's the kind of malt I really don't like, the malt that tastes like it smells before you even brew the beer, just a complete grain taste. We will see, but the smell doesn't give me high hopes. Well on the first taste I took I couldn't really detect any hops, and frankly I thought the beer was extremely boring on the first taste. However, on the second and third sips, the hops are coming out a little bit more. The malts are for sure not too bad, they aren't really the kind of bad taste I was detecting on the smell. This is a very drinkable beer, and not bad by any means, but I frankly wish there was more taste to it. On some tastes this beer deserves a 4, but on others it deserves a 3.5, so I dunno. The taste just isn't as bold and powerful as it could be, but it is crisp and refreshing, and it does have some nice flavors to it. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, a little thin, but it does have some girth to it, not too bad. Overall a good beer, not amazing, but good. Frankly I can't find anything too wrong with it other than the smell, but I guess it just wasn't hitting on all cylinders for me, for some reason. I could totally understand and respect this beer getting a A- from someone else, it just wasn't doing that for me today.

review/text: Pouring at room temp into a pint glass. Just got this from my buddy Ragingbull in a trade. Pours a bright clear copper hue with fluffy eggshell white head of 2 cm foaming up. Fades at a steady pace leaving some large lattice on the glass and creating some large craters in the foam. Relatively quickly gets to a sturdy surface layer.	Aroma is some grainy malt and hints of corn husk and caramel with some grassy hops and just a hint of pine sap.	First sip reveals an average body with very mild, smooth, rolling carbonation. Texture is soft and silky on each sip.The beer really caresses my palate.	 The flavor is as nose advertises with some grainy malt going to caramel. Then come the hops, grassy and pine again come into play and bitter up my mouth a little, but actually give back to a husky grainy finish.	No hint of ABV which is good since the can says 5.6 and I shouldnt really be able to get that anywhere.	A nice easy drinking session beer in a can.	I like it!

review/text: Pour: Clear red-amber in color with a tall two and a half fingers of white head that retains decently and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. 		Smell: Faint aroma with some piney hops, a little bit of malt, and a hint of iced tea.		Taste: Rich biscuit malty taste with a fair bit of caramel as well. The middle is nutty and the beer finishes up semi-sweet and with quite a punch of piney hops.		Mouthfeel: Light with a fair amount of carbonation, but not overly done. Crisp and clean. 		Drinkability: Easily drinkable and very sessionable. Could have a few easily. 		Final Notes: A very good amber ale - lots of biscuity, caramelly goodness but the hoppy back end is also a pleasant surprise. And it comes in a can, perfect for tailgating, fishing trips, or on the links.

S - Sweet malt smell, kinda toasty with no pronounced hop aroma that I could pick up.		T - Nice caramel/toasty flavors here with some hops peeking in on the back end. Very well balanced between malts and hops. 		M - Smooth body and not overly carbonated.		D - All and all very drinkable. Glad I snatched one of the five they had left in the make your own six pack aisle. That being said, hopefully there are some left when I go back.

review/text: Being East coast, I've never had a beer from Oregon (Wine yes - beer no). And I've never had an amber in a can. So when receiving an Ashland Amber from a friend, I was anxious to give it a go.		A - Poured a perfect copper color into a 25th anniversary Bell pint glass, nice head, retention, and lacing		S - I smell nothing. Nothing. 		T - Very smooth, nothing harsh, but lacking in character. Little hop finish. I was expecting a bit more malt flavoring.		M - Good and smooth. Very approachable.		D - Very easy drinking. Half way thru, and literally looking at it as a half empty Bells pint glass , I was wishing it was a Bells Amber.

review/text: Appearance: Slightly hazy orange-copper body beneath a creamy head of yellowed off-white. Head retention is very good; lacing is good.	Smell: Lots of toasty caramel malt. It's like golden caramel with a few kernels of barley, a hint of cocoa, and some nuts in it. Floral and citrusy hops. Very nice. 	T: The hops make a greater appearance in the flavor, but the wide, sweetish malt still remains the focal point. It's nicely balanced between malt and hops; and a very firm bitterness anchors it. It finishes drying with notes of leafy and grassy hops as the malt erodes from the palate.	M: Medium bodied and gently crisp. Smoother as it warms.	D: English in origin, but decidedly American, Caldera's amber is readily accessible to even the most basic drinker, yet still satisfying to the initiated. Quite drinkable!

review/text: A - Pours a hazy amber hue with a large, fluffy white head, with decent retention and lacing.		S - Smell is of caramel malts and pine, with citrus notes.		T - Taste is of toasty, biscuit-like caramel malts, with a balancing, but resinous pine flavor, and some citrus fruits (grapefruit, lemon). Pretty standard fare amber flavors, but done very well. Good degree of balance between being malty and hoppy.		M - Medium-bodied, with modest carbonation, and slightly noticeable hop oils (Not IPA-like, but there).		D - Very quaffable stuff for sure. Great for sessioning!		Overall - A nice gem in the rough of the amber ale category. A solid session beer that packs good flavor too. Recommended.

I can't tell how it smells because I got this stupid axe body wash for christmas and that's all i can smell when i raise the glass to my mouth. It's got great color, good head and great taste. It's a little sweet, not too bitter. I would definitely get it again.

review/text: Poured into a standard pint glass a clear amber wich was expected,a huge blossoming white head that stuck like glue,maybe not so much,very nice.Toasty caramel malt shows thru more than the herbal hops in the nose wich was also a bit unexpected,maybe not so nice.Toasty,bready malt is the main attraction flavor wise,the hops are herbal in form and come in late giving a nice finish.Would I have liked more hops...yeah but its a well rounded amber.I guess I was thinkin this would be a hopped up amber,and it was more hoppy than many,I would have liked just a little more.

review/text: This is a very sweet beer--my drinking buddy said "pine syrup," and I saw his point--but it's a decent American Amber. There's a lot of toasted/earthy malt in the nose and some light yeast. 		It tastes like caramel, steel, pine, a lot of sweetness--butterscotch?--and a hint of citric hop. The sugar also makes it a little rough in the texture and the drinkability areas--I liked the beer, you know, and I would recommend it, but it was just a bit too sweet for my tastes. I want more depth in an amber.

review/text: This is a very good American amber ale, definitely in the west coast style but not run-of-the-mill, with good complexity, balance, etc.		Copper-amber, it has a medium-big tan head steadily shrinking to a foamy ring and leaving a little bit of lace.		Aroma is pine bark, grapefruit, perfumy-dusty barley (a bit like Napa Smith Amber Ale but much better, more subtle and well-rounded), plus hint of pineapple.		Taste is basically a very good, balanced, firm, well-rounded, and characterful interpretation of standard west-coast style. It's peppery and a bit juicy with hint of grapefruit up front, nice fruity-toasty character, a malt sweetness that is light but firm and balances the leafy-peppery hop bite. Feel is good, solid but no heavy.

They really do brew to style well, the ipa, pale and amber are very discernable from one another. Lots of caramel, slight hops, just how amber should be done, if not by me baby!

Winey/pruney, roasted malt, dried fruit stones, some toffee and caramel, nutty.		T. Roasted malt, some sweetness beautifully counter balanced by the hop kick. Some notes that are sinilar to one or two barleywines I have had in the past. Some nuttiness in there too.		M. Medium, slightly chewy.		D. A thoroughly enjoyable amber ale. This is my first 'craft' beer in a can and I am really impressed by it. Such a shame there is no Best Before or Brewed on date stamped on the can.

review/text: Nice amber colored beer, as to be expected. Decent head on this one as well.		Smells hoppy, especially from an amber ale, I guess from Oregon though that's not too crazy. Very floral and grapefruity, slightly piney.		All hops up front, but quickly transforms into a malt forward beer. Very, very interesting. It's bitter upfront in a grassy way, but then it just changes immediately to toasty malt. Fantastic.		Medium-bodied brew, excellent drinkability.

review/text: Thanks to jtrockchalk for sending me this pretty little can. In the land of Surly it looks quaint, weighing in at 12 oz. I've been delighted by my first two Caldera beers, hoping that the streak continues today. 		Pours nicely out of the squat can with no canning date. Surprisingly hazy red, I guess I just assumed this would be hard-filtered. Smells like Nicole Kidman would if she was hopped, malted, & stuffed into a can. Brilliant balance. 		Ashland Amber opens with a malty bang. Hard on comes an assortment of fall nuts, sans salt, & do they have staying power. The acorns cling tenaciously to the palate. I'll not be surprised if squirrels claw their way through the siding, drywall, & fridge door to get into these cans. Light hopping, eyeful of bitter, pepper. Perhaps one of the thickest, chewiest ambers I've had, this could easily pass into brown, or almost porter, territory. That, combined with the tastiness & lovely perfume, make this difficult to sip. 		Excellent beer, one of the better ambers I've tasted in quite a while. Another winner. Caldera cans would sure look good in the cases next to Furious. Just a thought.

review/text: 12oz can, unknown date. 		Pours hazy red/copper/amber with a one finger off white head that holds a good cap but only leaves a few short-lived spots of lacing. 		Aroma is some caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, grassy, floral hops, bready and yeasty, touch of citrus and fruity esters, good strength. 		Flavor is somewhat fruity, pears and apples, some citrus, caramel, toffee, bready malt, fairly sweet, low bitterness. Sweet finish. 		Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, low to medium carbonation. 		Very good Amber Ale, but not as robust as Bell's excellent Amber Ale.

review/text: Very clear and crisp medium dark amber color. Some carbonation but not much. Half finger head. Lacing isn't great but pretty solid. Below the style but this style does well in this.		Smells of a strong amber/hopped aroma. A bit metallic in aroma a bit perhaps off or the hops are a touch off what I like.		Wow and blah. Opens oddly enough with hops a touch hoppy but not over powering. Somewhat herbal hops that quickly are squelched by a huge body of malt. OK, huge by the style, not huge by any other style. The amber malt flavor is there, but this is far more powerful than many are. 		It's too sweet and thick in body for most beers. The carbonation is lacking which also hurts. 		It's a nice drinkable beer in certain places, but when that is is beyond me. That's the problem though...when is a mostly malty beer without a sipper level of flavor the right beer for the time? Add in it is a far more thick bodied beer and I'm at a loss. 		I paid 16 for a 6 pack. I'm sorry but that's going into the score. Cans were made to make it cheaper to distribute and better for drinking here and there. Way to expensive way too...below average.

review/text: Grabbed a six pack of this one in a recent trade. Pours from the can a medium amber color, with a whitish head. Nice moderate hoppiness on the nose (pine, citrus) leads to a medium bodied palate, with citrus, caramel and sweet malt. A nice, easy drinking summer beer.

review/text: Appearance - a decent amber colored iced-tea brew. A brief head fades to nothing after a minute. I suppose it wouldn't matter much if left in the can.		Aroma - toasty, biscuity nose. A brief glint of sweetness fades to reveal some faint hop fruitiness.		Taste - nice toasty grain here. A light, grapefuit hop balances beautifully. Simple, straightforward, and a very flavorful amber.		Mouthfeel - a nice smooth feel, hefty crispness, medium weight, maybe a little lighter.		Drinkability - excellent session beer if you can afford it. I think I dropped a sawbuck for the sixer. Great all round beer. Not as fully flavored as Sam Adams stock ale, but holds its own admirably.

review/text: 12oz can with no freshness date.		Head stacks up high, sudsy and sticky. Clear and amber ... they nailed it there. Citric peel and pine sap with a faint caramel base in the nose. A little wet, lighter body ... touch of smoothness as well. Nutty bready malt throws down a quick flash of caramel, hops are assertive yet don't mess with the malt to the point of clouding out its flavor. Balanced with a long trail of flavor in the drying after taste.		I'll check this off on my personal session beer list, good flavor all around and lots of it. A kick-ass Amber.

review/text: A - burnt amber color, tall white head that leaves a good deal of lacing.		S - caramel sweet scent, not bitter, almost some porter in the mix.		T - sort of some vanilla caramel tossed into a lager.		M - mild coating with zero tingle.		D - the lack of bitterness combined with smooth feel make it easily drinkable if this is what you are looking for.

review/text: 12 oz. can tried 19 Jul 2009.		Served in the 0.5 L Adambrau becker. Large light brown lacy head. Well carbonated. Clear dark reddish brown. Aroma is almondy, some brown sugar, a little dusty, slightly astringent. Sweet and almondy, caramel. Some astringnet almond skins in the finish. Bitteness increases slightly in the finish. Light body. Light alcohol. 		Decent but not likely to get again.

review/text: A - Pours a clear copper color with 1 finger thick white head. Head retention is good. Good amount of carbonation visible.		S - Citrus hops and roasted malt dominate the smell. Fairly light smelling, not too complex, but well balanced.		T - Follows the aroma pretty well. Starts off with rich roasted malts, soon overpowered by an intense nutty flavor that lingers for the rest of the sip. Citrus undertones are there throughout.		M - Medium to light bodied, slight tingle from the carbonation. Finish is slightly dry with a nutty aftertaste, no hop bitterness at all.		D - Very well balanced beer. Mark these down just a dollar or two per 6-pack and I would buy this regularly.

review/text: Another opportunity to be impressed with a canned craft beer.		It pours a light copper color with a head that builds fast but recedes to a thin ring.		Supremely balanced all around with soft caramel, nutty, toasted malt and a flourish or citric and earthy hops at the end just before a fairly dry finish.		Damn, I'd routinely have this in my fridge if not for the $11/sixer price tag. Notch this up with the IPA and Pale Ale as another more-than-solid offering from Caldera.

review/text: Can with a distinctive lime green pop tab, poured into a pint glass, picked up at Corks and Kegs in Richmond, VA.		Pours tawny amber brown (Yuengling-ish?) with a poofy, rocky, eggshell-tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a bit of lace. Decent look.		Smell is a sucker punch in the nostrils. Not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but the nose was a big surprise. Overhwelmingly bitter and floral, with caramel sweetness singing backup. Maybe I should start believing some of the hype about cans preserving the beer so well.		As surprising as the pungency of the smell was the incongruity of the flavor profile. Just plain uninteresting in contrast to the huge nose- a dash of floral hops, not a ton but enough to outweigh the barely-there malt backbone. Out of balance and generally weak. 		Seems like some soft, mellow bitterness evolves once the beer is gone. In fact, I think I enjoy this beer more after the swallow. 		Decently smooth and inoffensive, but not worth a second visit.

review/text: 12 oz. can with no freshness date: poured a deep and clear reddish to brown with ruby highlights. The creamy, tan head quickly recedes. 		The aroma is spicy and syrupy with some faint hop odor. 		The first sip emphasized malty sweetness with a faint bite of hops mixed in. There is a very slight licorice flavor in the aftertaste that is pleasing. 		The mouthfeel is actually a little thick and chewy with the sweetness keeping the palate coated. All the same, the ale remains refreshing with a zesty carbonation. 		This is a good, malt-accented amber ale that maintains good balance. I was surprised to see this along with the pale ale in Louisville, KY. It is the most I have ever paid for a six-pack, but it is worth trying.

review/text: Picked up a can at Abe's Cold Beer. The beer looks amber with a short white head. The aroma is a mix of light and juicy citrus with cocoa bread malt. That same barley character holds over into the flavor with a mix of pepper and lemon peel. The bitter aftertaste is a touch earthy and balances the sweet malt nicely. It's not the most flavorful, but at the same time the body is on the lighter side, making for a drinkable amber. Overall, a respectable session beer.

review/text: Pour - fills this glass with an amazingly colorful auburn liquid with some flashes of ruby red and bright orange with a big thick batter-like off-white head on top. 		Aroma - bread dough, caramel, apple butter, raw sugar, cocoa and some slight citrus. Smells great. I can't wait to move on to the best part of all of this.		Taste - big malty, biscuity, bready sweetness hits the palate immediately. This may be a simple recipe but it sure has been perfected. This has the perfect balance of maltiness and some citrus hops to balance things out. The malt profile is something I am really enjoying, I'm not sure how best to describe it. I'd have to say its somewhere between honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts. Well, maybe not that sweet but it is surely delicious. 		Overall - great amber ale, one that I could definitely enjoy in multiple amounts. I love the flavor that this imparts and the great balance that it has with the PNW hops used. Amber Ales may not be my favorite style but this is proof that I could love any beer if its brewed well. 		Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I had access to Caldera out here but its also nice to know that its a regional brewery and I'll be sure to stop in to the brewpub if I am ever in Ashland again.

review/text: 12 ounce can with no best before date poured into a pint glass. Thanks Flexabull for this Oregon brew.		The Ashland Amber pours an amber color with great clarity. A small quick dissolving head is present. Aroma is quite sweet with lots of caramel, breads, yeast, and malts. Some fruits come through with warming. Quaff is slightly watery but some malts and toffee. Pretty smooth drinking brew for the mediocre ABV. Mouthfeel is crisp and thin. Drinkability is good. I would like to know the freshness of this brew but it is definitely enjoyable on a summer day. Very sessionable.

No hop presence. Just a malty amber.		T: Big malt backbone on the palate, brown sugar and bread dough. Some citrus but very muted. Almost has a brown ale flavor.		M: Very palatable, would be good for a bbq. Just crisp enough to make it refreshing. 		D: Easily drinkable beer, good flavor but nothing overwhelming.

review/text: I picked this can up at Al's of Hampden, poured chilled from the can into a tulip.		A - a ruby colored ale, excellent clarity w/ 3fingers of light beige cap w/ mix of bubbles sized large and tiny. The lace clings very well and retention is good. The color reminds me of cranberry juice which is attractive to look at in the light		S - A sweet toasted grainy odor w/ light fruitiness and berry-like yeast ester w/ a mild hop aroma and slight caramel notes w/ gentle vegetal aroma		M - a moderately carbonated brew w/ mild bitterness and gentle sweetness. The texture has light toasted and spice aspects w/ dry finishing medium body overall		T - the flavor is relatively biscuity upfront and has subtle pine notes from the hops w/ light creamy caramel malt taste. There is a gently fruity element from the yeast which allows the toasted grain note to carry over and seems to be the focus from midpoint on. the toast or roasted notes are the focus w/ mild herbal and the fruity quality adding contrast. The spice tinges mellow and a very light citrus in the hops comes out when warmer w/ another layer of flavor unfolding. The contrast makes the amber very balanced but seems to lean toward malt ever so slightly w/ strong biscuit taste until the semi-dry finish		D - A solid beer in every way, very good representation of the style w/ satisfying drinkability. I would drink this with barbecue or meatloaf. The drinkability is good and I would look for this again I Can guarntee that (wink, wink)

Same with the malt profile. Cloudier than most, not much lacing. Nothing outstanding, nothing wrong. Worth a shot if you see it.

It has a well balanced aroma of pale and crystal malts along with a nice hop scent and some light yeast esters. The taste is good. 	It has a nice, easy drinking flavor. It has it all; good malt character, mild hops, and some light yeast fruitiness. It's not mind blowing, but it's solid and damn drinkable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average amber ale. It's pretty standard in composition, but for some reason, I really like it.

review/text: 12oz CAN into a regular kitchen glass.		A- A nice reddish/ amber color with a nice, gorgeous actually, dark tan head that looked like liquid brown sugar. Very bubbley with legs to stand. No lace, just some small dots on the top.		S- Smells regular for the style, some malt character faint hops with no bitterness. Small dark fruit aroma and a hint of chocolate but I may be off on that.		T- Very bland, very basic and not opening my eyes at all. Malt sweetness with caramel, no hops hitting the tounge, not even a lick. The little bit of pear in the back is helping but not much. I know this is a basic style and all but I would take a yuengling over this any day.		M- The build stops short of medium with a smooth but almost watery feel. There really is not much going on here. The carb seemed ok by the nice head, but this is pretty dead.		D- Not really, I figured since this brewery just came into the area that they would send some fresh product. This is just not doing anything for me. "way down in the hole."- Tom Waits

review/text: Pours bright orange amber with a thin white head. Some trailing lace sticks.		The smell is of caramel, light toast, with citric hop spicing backing up the maltiness.		The taste is of sweet caramel, a bit steely with citric, piney, spicy hops balancing it evenly in the finish.		It has a smooth, creamy medium body.		A malt-accented at the start, finishing balanced with a nice lingering aftertaste. A solid American Amber!

review/text: 12 oz. can poured into a trusty pint glass. Pour nets an inch of cream or light tan head crowning a crystal clear medium amber body. Decent retention and lace. The aroma hits the nostrils with the same blend of hops that is familiar to me from their pale ales, lots of resiny pine character. Second to that is a lightly nutty caramel malt element. Taste has a mild sweetness which turns into a crisp resinous hoppiness. Caramel or nougaty malt balance pops up in the midpalate as well, but the finish splits nicely between malt and full on hops. High level of hops for an amber, actually very close to the pales, but I like this better with the malt balance. Medium thick body with a creamy medium carbonation. Recommended, my favorite Caldera of the three cans I have tried.

review/text: CAN you believe it?!? The CANQuest rolls along nicely. Now, for those may be arriving late to today's program, already well in progress, I not only review the beers, but I also transcribe the verbiage so that you do not have to. 		I thought that Ska was very clever: It's [Modus Hoperandi] label read: "Walk, Kite, Recycle, Hide, Seek, Plant, Recycle, Grow, Shower, HHH, Tube, Recycle." 		But now, from this one's exterior: " 'Live Product. Keep Cool. Just Like You." Yeah, man. How many times have my students heard me say, "Be cool, baby. Be real cool."? Innumerable. A ring around the neck read "Go Biking ... Go Rafting ... Go CANS! ... Go Skiing ... Go Fishing ... Go Snowboarding ... www.calderabrewing.com". 		It reminds me of the joke of the financially strapped male children looking for something to do on a hot summer's day. They pool their limited resources and send one of their number to the local grocer's, only to have him return with a box of tampons. Incredulous at this purchase, one of them inquires as to his choice. His response: "Well, the box reads, 'With this product, you can go swimming, camping, fishing and a whole host of fun activites'." Har!		Yeah, me, I'm going to skip all of that fun stuff with the exception of "Go CANS!" Here we go, CANS, here we go!		A friend of mine in the industry remarked that he feels that the days of generic "Amber" beers have passed. I disgree, but let's see how this stacks up.		The finger-and-a-half of head was light-tan with good retention. Remember that "Live Product" jazz? Well, it had a slight haze to its deep-amber color suggestive of the presence of yeast. CAN-conditioned?!? Holy Drop the Corks and Cages, Batman! Gee, the nose smelled nothing like an amber of yore. Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow! How many more CANs of this do I have left? Somebody said that they have distribution in MD ... Bye!

review/text: 12oz can picked up today at Brewforia.. badass... another brewery available here in Boise!! Poured into my Delirium goblet.		short lasting white head... only bits of splotch lace.. the brew is a clear orange/amber.		nose is toasty malts with lite citrus hops.. sorta earthy.		Flavor has more hops than the aroma... the malts are again leaning toward the toasty side.. some minor caramel adds to the overall product.. good body and carbonation... 		I'm not the biggest fan of American Ambers.... they just all pretty much taste the same.. this is really no exception.. just a nice well made beer that would be great for hitting hot springs or fishing.		More props to Rick... I will be hitting Brewforia often and pimping it with my online buddies... Congrats on really getting things off the ground.		3.5/3/3.5/3.5/4

review/text: A-Bright, clear, copper with a medium light tan head that reduced to a thin veil and left spotty lace.		S-Lightly sweet caramel malt with a touch of hop spiciness and some jaunty fruit aroma.		T-Sweet (but not overly so) caramel malt with a toffee kick. Nice spicy hop bite with a sweet fruit ending.		M-Medium bodied, smooth with a pronounced softness. Goes down easy with nice lingering balance of sweetness and hop spiciness.		D-A solid, easy to drink, "beer". This would be the type of brew to have on hand to serve to less discriminating guests. Enough flavour for the geeks in the group but not so in your face that BMC types would curl up their noses in disgust. I have been impressed with all three of the canned Caldera beers I have had, well done.

review/text: Six pack from Hi-Times - $10.00		Love the idea of good canned beer!		A- Poured into a glass..a nice red hue with thick tan head.		S- Smells of hop with little sweetness. Very familiar smell.		T- Nice hoppy zing. Floral with very subtle malt. Very much reminds me of a refined Sierra Nevada.		D- Very easy to drink. Not so hoppy or malty that it destroys your tastebuds. For the price, I still think this beer can get int rotation.

review/text: This one is from Beertracker, thanks Jeff!!		Pours caramel colored with 2 fingers of khaki head. Very good head retention & above average lacing 		S: Breadyness & herbal hops		T: Biscuitty malt, brown sugar, toffee & herbal hops up front. Caramel & brown bread battle it out with herbal & piney hops as this warms, some toffee as well. Finishes with flinty dryness, brown bread & slight astringency		MF: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation & good balance		Drinks very easy, doesn't come as hop forward as PNW Amber should be in my mind, but very quaffable

I'm getting a clean taste that is almost too clean tasting. Almost the same taste that you get from Absolute Vodka. The malt taste is good, but there is just something very unbalanced here.		M- Semi thin, but leaves your mouth flemmy.		D- Meh, its ok, but not fantastic.

T: The first thing that hits is the hops.. citrus, and perhaps a little grassy. After that it fades off a bit.. 		M: A little spicy at the front, but then it feels a tad watery.		D: Nice and refreshing, but I feel like it is lacking in body, and the flavor is lacking complexity. I would get it at a bar if it was available, but I wouldn't choose it over other craft brews.

review/text: Pours a clear reddish-brown, with a thin, creamy tan head. Smell is of freshly brewed tea. Taste is sweet toasted malt up front, with a super biscuity middle, and earthy, tea like finish. Good bitterness levels to match up with the malt. Mouthfeel is super rich, nice low carbonation levels. Drinkability is very good, this is a great example of an American Amber Ale, that is conveniently available in cans.		Reminds me of a New Belgium Fat Tire on steroids.

review/text: I'd previously only known Ashland Amber from draught servings at bars in Ashland where connecting with its full potential was a haphazardous pursuit. Its recent availability in cans provides a welcome addition to their two other canned ales, this one in a colorful display of purple and green on silver. Ashland walks on the dark side of amber and is built on a core alt structure. Its doughy aroma corkscrews through piecrust and malt sweetness while the taste has candied caramel with no more than balancing hops. Good clean fun. 			Instructions: first, remember that canned beer is good. Next, don't be lulled into thinking that canned be should be served cold. Allow to reach proper ale temps before serving.

review/text: Pours clear copper with a nice, fluffy head and good lacing. The aroma is caramel, with a little hint of slightly sourish hops, perhaps a bit piney. The flavor is strongly caramel, with a sweet edge and nice piney and floral hops. The mouthfeel is fairly robust and slick, with little carbonation bite. This beer exists mostly in the front end - very little in the way of hop bitterness on the finish and only a little lingering caramel.

review/text: Fairly standard of American Amber Ales, which all tend to be a bit sweet and boldly bitter with little hop flavor or aroma- definatley malt forward.		The beer decants into one of my fancy-schmancy Sam Adams pint glasses with a brilliant copper hue, fair head formation, fair retention, and with some mild lacing. Great color and clarity.		Aromas of biscuity maltiness and caramel-toffee prevail with only the lightest hint of herbal hop aroma. Simple understated fruity esters help to add variety to the aroma without bullying. A simple malty aroma.		Flavors of caramel and toffee prevail along with soft butterscotch and sorgum comming into the finish. Again, biscuit sweetness and herbal hops make a direct transition from the aroma to flavor. Malty flavored but also a lot of unresolves sweetneess. Fruity notes here and there help with the complexity but keep the flavors from becomming as clean as they could be.		A bit disjointed in texture because of the unattenuated sugars leaving a film on the mouth. But also shooting for dryness with the sharp bittering hops which cause too much of a bite going past the throat. Still malty throughout with grain flavors and textures late.		Again a nice but ordinary Amber. The hop bitterness doesn't seem to be supported with the pleasant hop flavor or aroma, and allows the hops to bite too much. Those who like sweeter, English-style ales may find this one appealing. Reminds me a lot of Anerson Valley Boont Amber.		Thanks BlueOkie!

review/text: Polished kumquat with crystalline clarity. The look and sound of the pour suggests that the mouthfeel will be excellent. Three fingers of thick and creamy foam sit atop the beer and look damn good while doing so. Large sheets of Swiss cheese-like lace stick to the glass.		The nose has a bit too much toasted-nutty-earthy malt for my liking, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber an amber ale rather than an APA. The Cascade and Galena hops aren't as prominent as they are in this brewery's Pale Ale and IPA, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber...		Leave it to Caldera to give Ashland Amber more hops than beer of this style usually sees. Maybe that's why I like their stuff so much. Malt (pale and crystal) has not been slighted. It tastes and feels like there's a considerable amount of barley present, especially for the ABV.		Specifics include steely caramel, roasted peanuts, bitter black tea leaves and a prodigious shaving of grapefruit peel. The beer is balanced in terms of malt flavor vs. hop flavor, but bitterness supercedes sweetness at all points along the way. This is well-crafted beer that is a pleasure to drink.		All things considered, the mouthfeel really is excellent, as the visual and auditory cues said it would be. It's full and lush for the style and the ABV, which makes it the highlight of an already enjoyable experience. Hey guys, can you teach other brewers how to do what you do?		Although I'd take Caldera Pale Ale and Caldera IPA over Ashland Amber any day of the week, this is a wonderfully hoppy amber ale that just about any craft beer lover should enjoy. I would dearly love to have easy access to these brews.

review/text: Most beers self-described as amber ales aren't too exciting and this one, while solid, falls into that category.		Appearance is a very reddish and bright body with a soapy head that quickly fades to a light scum around the edges of the glass. Aroma is biscuit-y at first, with some hops around the edges of the malt aroma..."balanced" came to mind as a descriptor. Flavor is mostly malty, but has a nice mellow caramel character and some metallic-ness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty good, but not exactly a knock-out.		BTW - I liked the packaging of this beer; both that it was in a can and the artwork on the can.		Thanks to JaBier for supplying me a can of this beer!

review/text: I actually used to live in the Ashland that this beer is named for and where it's brewed, so I felt obliged to give it a shot. Poured from the can into a pint glass...		Appearance: For an amber, the color seems off as it is just a pretty plain coppery color with a nice, clear body -- I guess I would expect at least some ruby-esque highlights in there, if not a strong amber body...; light carbonation; one finger slightly off-white head that fades to a nice thick skim and very sparse lacing that's very thin.		Smell: Mild, rassy smelling hoppy aroma with some lightly toasted malts; something seems amiss in the nose though and it's got a bit of rotted vegetative scent that reminds me of cabbage. Not a good start, but there have been other times where I've smelled something similar in ambers and haven't been let down by the flavor so I'm optimistic.		Taste: Mostly getting the toasty malts and some of the mildly bitter hop presence, but not much else overall it's very mild... Not bad, but I have definitely had much more flavorful ambers that rate much higher than this.		Mouthfeel: Body is thin and water and a little flat; finsih is wet and is like drinking malt flavored water. 		Drinkability: Overall, it's not hard to drink, but there's not much reason to do so. The flavors are mild and meek, the body is super watery and doesn't offer much, so I don't feel I will be drinking this again.

review/text: Picked this up on a can-buying spree this weekend. Poured into a pint glass for review. 		Appearance: Pours a light toasty amber with some coppery highlights. The liquid is clear and supports a 1/2 finger thin, white foamy head with weak, filmy lacing by tons of carbonation bubbles. 		Smell: Light malt iwth a hint of floral hops and not much more. Disappointing.		Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste with a little bit of malt, sweet grains, lots of water and lots of meh - nothing special here to talk about. Feel is weak, watery and thin. 		Drinkability: Not so much when you consider it tastes like a bad macro.

review/text: 12 oz can into a pint glass. 		Pours a clear coppery amber with 2+ fingers of off-white head. This retains down into a big creamy dollop, which leaves a sticky latticework of lacing back. The aroma is very fresh, spicy, and floral smelling (maybe a touch of more herbal qualities as well), with some fuller notes of tropical fruits and bready malts mixing in nicely. 		The taste starts with a light-moderate spicy bitterness with a solid backbone of citrus and toasted caramel imparting a sharp tang, before fading into a lingering dry and spicy feel. The hops profile that is present really is all about the spice. The mouthfeel is lighter-medium bodied with a VERY easy carbonation in the mouth. Maybe a bit too easy. While it's not quite watery, it does appear to be a bit thin in spots. Not enough to really hurt the quaffable nature of this though. 		I liked this. One of the more fuller flavored and easy drinking Ambers that I've had recently. This was another solid canned offering form Caldera.

review/text: A light red pour finishes off with a one-finger, bubbly tan head. A few nubs of lace jut up the side of the pint glass. Sweet malts and distant hops rise to the nose. Typical, subtle, not great, not bad. Taste involves a little spice and hops up front. Some malts exist in the middle. A light-bodied brew that works well for me at the moment, and the cans sure would come in handy in a lot of situations.

review/text: Poured from Can into Pint glass.		Pours a clear radiant amber color with a fizzy off-white head that quickly dissolves into some wispy remnants. The aroma has biscuit malts, some brown sugar and some very faint hop scents. It has a lot of caramel malt up front with some hops on the end to round out the flavor. Its a light bodied beer with plenty of carbonation. This is something I'd buy if I were looking to take it easy on my taste buds. Extremely sessionable.

A bit of raw grain, with some fruity esters. There's a touch of sugar and some really nice floral notes. It's a very pleasing aroma. 		The taste is ok. There's some raw grain, haylike quality. It's slightly bitter as well. It's earthy, and kind of herbal. Not too bad.		Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated.		Drinkability is fairly high.

review/text: 12oz can into nonic.		Clear copper hue with a one finger light tan head that slowly settles to a thin cap. The head seemed sort of thin, with a lot of tiny little bubbles stacked like shipping peanuts. It didn't have that dense frothiness that I enjoy seeing. 		Toasty malts, along with a strong and sharp, but very herbal, hop aroma. 		More toasted malts along with a lot of sweet caramel. The hop flavor is very tea like, not giving strong citrus characteristics. Full bodied, with maybe slightly below average carbonation. 		I feel like this one could almost be called an Irish Amber Ale just from the flavor characteristics, especially from the hops. It's certainly a unique Amber Ale, especially one coming from the east coast. Rather than a load of sharp citrus, there is a softer herbal quality. Recommended.

review/text: Shared this growler with a friend last night, filled on Friday.		Pours a bright and clear dark gold gold, almost amber, with a very nice white head.		Aromas are nice, pleasant and hoppy. Mostly hard candies and sweet citrus, maybe some orange and mango.		Taste is just like the nose. Lots of hoppy and semi sweet citrus flavors. Some mango, peach, orange, cream, bread and with some crystal malt flavors. Finish is crisp with some mild resin and fruity bitterness. This is a well balanced beer, with both good malt sweetness, and plenty of hop flavors.		Mouthfeel is very nice, smooth, full, and nice mellow carbonation.		Overall, an excellent beer. The beer is listed here as a Pale, the server said the same thing, but this seems a bit strong, and bordering on an IPA. But I really don't care what this is, it's that good. I wish Caldera would consider bottling or canning this.

review/text: Poured from tap into pint glass at Nano-brew festival PDX.		Brewer's notes (couldn't find online, just on the card I had):		"This beer gets its name from the Hop Union Hop Hash nuggets..." "...the beer is designed to be a surprise on all fronts. Even the brewer had no idea how hoppy it would be. (Last keg of this beer)."		Poured a lovely pale ale/IPA copper hue with decent head retention and very fine lace. Really intense on the nose. Amazingly complex but dominated by the hops and hop oils. Bright citrus, bread, and cooked oats all waft out. Lots going on. On the palate, the beer is richly flavored and insanely dry with intense hops that never really seem to be too over the top. The texture is lovely with a great finish. This was the beer of the night! Intense, yes, but with complexity and nuances to help round it out, the resulting beer never seems to be too much.

review/text: Big thanks to Casey for sharing this one...		Poured from a bomber into a RR snifter...		A - Pours black with a one finger light brown head. Head retention is decent at best, and lacing is minimal...		S - Roasted malts, oak/vanilla, and lots of chocolate. Scent comes through deliciously sweet...		T - Chocolate foward with a good dose of vanilla. Oak and roasted malts also come through, with a slightly bitter finish...		M - Rich and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. On the lighter side of being full bodied with a dry finish...		O - Excellent brew. Definitely something i'm looking foward to trying again...		Cheers...

review/text: Enjoyed a glass of this last night at Caldera's tap house.		Pours a very dark brown color, with a thin off white head.		Aromas are of very dark semi sweet cocoa with hints of cream and coffee.		Flavors are just like the nose. Dark cocoa, semi sweet, creamy, with some brown sugar, espresso, and hints of oak. Finish is crisp, with really subtle booziness.		Mouthfeel is nice, full, smooth, and lightly carbonated.		Overall this is outstanding. This is an excellent beer that you can really taste the dark chocolate, but it still retains the flavors of a robust porter too. The balance is nice, very well done Caldera. Even my wife liked this, and she is not a fan of dark beers.

review/text: Dark brown, 3/4" head, tan. Aroma of chocolate, dark belgian candy sugar, bourbon.		Taste, decadent, yummy chocolate integrates well, one of the best barrel flavors I've experienced from oak spirals v. the barrel itself. Seems to be able to actually feel the 6 different malts used, all complimentary. Smooth, candy sugar gives a nice balance to it, never harsh, bitter, hides the alcohol extremely well. Chocolate really prominent, for the better. Mild vanilla component to it.		Nice price on it at the beerjoint for Caldera. Solid imperial porter.

review/text: On tap at SAVOR, beer served in a wine glass, sort of. Beer is brown / dark brown to black with nearly no head, clear at the corners of the glass. Low carbonation.		Beer smells like chocolate, like chocolate syrup, very strong. Yum.		Beer is sweet up front like a milk stout with a lot of chocolate on the palate and a mild to moderate bitter finish. The finish of the beer is wet and clean as well. Interesting overall but not great, not an A+ like it is on here in my opinion, a solid porter though.

review/text: On tap at SAVOR 2011.		Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head and some sparse lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward chocolate. Then there's some chocolate. And then ... wait for it ... some more chocolate. Nothing complex but well done and reminds me of Rogue Double Chocolate Stout. Some slight roast and a bit of espresso, but that's after I really try to find more character. It's one dimensional, but when the single dimension is that well done, there's not much to complain about. Medium body with average carbonation. Well done.

review/text: This Imperial Porter is definitely one of the best beers I've had from Caldera. Second only to the Old Growth Imperial Stout. I'd venture to say also that this is one of the best Porters I've had in a long time. The beer is close to black in color a thin brown head. The nose has hints of milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak. In my opinion that is the best nose composition a porter can have. The beer has a medium body and mild carbonation. As it moves across the pallet a strong flavor of dark chocolate hits your tongue with light hints of coffee and bittering acids. Caldera is known for their love of hops and this beer is no different but the hops add to the beers complex flavor profile. This beer could only be better if it had a fuller body and more vanilla and bourbon notes on the pallet. I loved this beer and would recommend it to any dark beer lover.

review/text: This review is for the bourbon barrel-aged version of Mogli imperial porter.		Draft pour into a dubbel goblet at the Caldera tasting room in Ashland.		A: Uniformly opaque black, with almost one finger of beige foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass.		S: Very sweet chocolate milk dominates the smell, with some vanilla and bourbon adding complexity.		T: Toffee, dark fruit, and vanilla to start with bourbon and bittersweet chocolate emerging later. The finish is smooth and full with bourbon. Bourbon flavor deftly asserts itself without being overpowering or intrusive. The presence of alcohol is also handled well here because alcohol flavors are not detectable.		M: Medium viscosity with low to moderate carbonation. This beer is very smooth and gently warming on the palate. While a heavier texture would not be out of place here, nothing about the mouthfeel of this beer is wrong.		D: This beer is both drinkable and delicious. Despite its spirit-infused imperial pedigree, the palate is not fatigued over the course of drinking a glass. Compared to a Ballast Point bourbon barrel-aged Victory at Sea sampled recently, this beer is more drinkable but less extravagantly flavored (and likely also lower in abv). This beer was sampled by three other beer drinkers unaccustomed to barrel-aged beer and each was impressed by it.

Slight roasted coffee flavor that isn't too bitter mingled with vanilla and dark chocolate with hints of oak and bourbon. I'm amazed at how distinct, yet subtle and well integrated each of the flavors are.		M: as wonderful as this beer tastes, the mouthfeel is the real high point of this beer. Licious and creamy, but just well carbonated enough to not be sludgy.		D: Wow. This is easily a top five beer. Not sure of the abv, but if it's big, it's well hidden. I could drink this all night long every night for a month and not get tired of it

review/text: One off brewed for Oregon Brewers Fest from my understanding. It was not barrel aged but used wood from bourbon barrels in the process, and is an imperial porter but there is no category for that on BA. 		Pours a very dark brown with a small head around the sides of the glass. Aroma is outrageous. Like the first sniff of chocolate milk back in elementary school. Then add extra cocoa and some espresso, vanilla, and bourbon. Taste is to die for. All kinds of chocolate, french vanilla ice cream, bourbon, dark roasted coffee, and the smallest hop bitterness for balance. Minimal alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is the best feature. One of the smoothest beers I have ever had. By far the best of the style I have ever had. Drinkability is unlimited. If they bottled this it would be a legend.

review/text: Labelled as Cwrw Ml Honey Fayre.		Pours slightly hazy golden with nice and foamy head that slowly dissipates to thin white layer, some patches of lacing. Aroma is dominated by mild and sweetish honey; some malty undertones present.		Taste is not as good as aroma - it is mild and slightly sweet malt with notes of honey, lemon, seemed even a bit astringent; drying finish. Mouthfeel is light with moderate/high carbonation.		Not a bad one in general, but could not find too much of honey in it.

M: Light to moderate body is smooth with an off-dry finish.		D: A decent drinker.		Some info from the Marks & Spencer press release:		"Welsh Honey Bitter is made using 100% Welsh honey sourced from Ceredigion, South Wales, creating a delicate beer with sweet honey aromas and a clean, dry finish. The unique blend of pale malts used to brew this particular bitter gives the brew a smooth texture with a light, fresh taste."

review/text: I had this beer at the Newcastle Arms in Newcastle, handpumped into a pint and served with a head that builds up from the bottom of the glass. The head turns into a thin off-white head on top of a dark brown beer. Not as dark as expected.		Smell is roasted, but not sharp or burned, actually quite mild. The hops are definatelly English, probably Goldings and bitterness is good. The hop aroma is not very pronounced. There is a nice English fruitiness. 		Taste is roasted, but more chocolate malt than roasted barley. A solid base of pale malt gives a somewhat sweet malt taste and to me this is a sweet Porter, a new style. The hops are medium hoppy and bitterness is good. Drinkability is good, for an English beer 5,6% is high, but alcohol is very well hidden.

review/text: Purchased at the Spar chain grocery store in Church Stretton, Shropshire (where I got plenty of other Welsh bottled beers!); bottle-conditioned in a 500ml brown bottle, BB 19/05/09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass.		A: dark reddish amber in colour, the carbonation comes very light and quiet, supporting an equally restricted thin sheet of off-white foam.	S: besides the dominant influence of yeastiness, traditional aroma of Golding-like tangerine-ish fruity hoppiness intertwines with raw-ish nuttiness, boiled root veggie, herbal tea and a touch of brown sugar. Very light and quiet in terms of aroma.	T: a lightly sour-sweet yeasty foretaste backed by powdery biscuity malts, boiled kidney beans and brown malts is ensued by a slightly chewy, ground-root-herb-like bitter-sweetness with a wee bit of spice. Restrained in hop-bitterness in the end while the lightly sour & faintly "smoky" (a tad phenolic) yeastiness also lingers. Simplistic.	M&D: quite smooth but slightly flat on the mouthfeel, the body is not thin but slightly too light to be honest. Overall, I don't think this bottle is conditioned as successfully as the other two Conwy RAIB products, as the semi-flat texture doesn't add any positive points to the overall timid performance. Just about average.

review/text: Pours hazy dark amber and large sediment settles on the bottom of the glass, small head, small lacing. Aroma is sweetish malt, fruity esters, hints of spicy yeast.		Taste is biscuity malt with sharp hoppy herbal bitterness that is enhanced by very strong carbonation. Notes of fruit and presence of yeast is felt as well.		The beer is drinkable, but it seemed that carbonation was excessive and there was too much of yeast residue.

review/text: 4th April 2010 was the date this bottle conditioned beer had to be drank by. It was opened and reviewed on 24th March, two weeks before.		Poured carefully into an 'Old Speckled Hen' vase shaped pint glass.		Clear light amber body with a good, large bubbled, white head on top. Sadly the head fell away to leave just a collar and a few wisps.		Sweetish hoppy aroma, flowery and semi-citrus at the same time.		Tangy and well carbonated, almost fizzy in the mouth. The beer (according to the label) contains Barley, Wheat and Gluten, as allergy advice. It also claims all their bottled beers are vegetarian. I liked its sharpness and the bitter aftertaste as the mouth dried, which left a nutmeg/corriander feel between gulps.		Not bad at all!

review/text: Purchased in Church Stretton, Shropshire, bottle-conditioned; BB 22/04/09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass.		A: dark amber hue with very good clarity (thanks to a careful pour), coming with a fast dissipating fluffy head and sporadic fizziness (rather large bubbles).	S: lightly metallic and salty notes, spicy-orangey hops, and a rather smooth sugary maltiness hover in the air... somewhat timid in the overall aroma, but in no sense unpleasant.	T: lightly biscuity and faintly honey-ish in the foretaste just like a typical English pale bitter, then the slightly herbal and also spicy bitterness of hops expand in the middle, preceding a rather quiet, soothing aftertaste with a light orangey-citric undertone and lingering waves of semi-herbal bitterness as of the work of phenol.	M&D: for a bottle-conditioned bitter, the texture is pretty clean and not tainted at all by the yeast sediments, making a refreshing and also soft palate; that said, this light-bodied bitter is somehow too timid in taste to sparkle more interests from drinkers (like me). The lingering subtle hop bitterness is very welcomed, though.

review/text: A - Pours with a small, one finger head of white foam that rests on top of a slightly hazy, golden body. The foam dissipates quickly and leaves moderate lace.		S - An aroma of dry bread with some malt and a bit of earthy, floral honey.		T - Dry malt up front with a cracker-like bread character. Floral honey and earthy hops show up in the middle. It finishes with a dry, slightly toasty malt note as well as moderate hop bitterness.		M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.		D - The hop bitterness and flavor are quite dominant throughout the beer and tend to suppress the honey, especially in the finish. The malt begins strong but fades towards the finish. It is also lacking in sweetness that could counter the fairly aggressive and musty hops. Not a bad beer, but not particularly well balanced or drinkable either. Worth a try, but if you can find this, you can likely find better beers along side of it as well.

review/text: Purchased at the Spar chain grocery store in Church Stretton, Shropshire (where I got plenty of other Welsh bottled beers!); coming in a 500ml brown bottle, BB 12/02/09, served cool in a straight imperial pint glass. According to the beer label, this "dry, refreshing honeyed ale" is brewed with Welsh honey from the New Quay Honey Farm. The brewery website also lists down numerous awards won by this beer: 	* Gold award for best golden ale at South Devon CAMRA beer festival 2007. 	* Double Silver Medal winner at SIBA West & Mold beer festivals 2006. 	* Double silver medal at The Great Welsh Beer & Cider festival 2007 & 2008.		A: pours a bright tawny hue with mixture of fine and huge bubbles in action, topped with a lingering white fluffy head.	S: upon the opening, a whiff of skunky note escapes from the bottle, albeit not pungent; in the glass, the aroma has resinous notes of hops, sweet/syrupy orangey citrusness, and intensity of nectar (due to the honey?) all coming before a lighter performance of biscuity malts... a swirl gives rise to a rather focused and clean flow of spicy-floral touch of English hops on top of the settled citrusness (a bit like Challenger to me).	T: the taste is yeasty, earthy and slightly grassy from the start (in a pleasant way), carrying with it a "settled" pale ale maltiness (with hints of raw-ish grains) and lightly sour-sweet citric+honey flavour; gradually, the latter two elements (sort of) intertwine to result in a clean palate of lingeringly aromatic honey-malty aftertaste, leaving ample space for the moderate-level hop bitterness with its tangy-citric edge to develop quietly at the back of the palate.	M&D: not bad in terms of bottle-conditioning, as shown by the refreshing (but not sharp) carbonation and a sound body that stays intact throughout the drink; somehow the honey is perhaps (too) well-consumed and leaves little trace in the beer, as compared with malts and citric hops, dragging down the performance a bit if one looks to have adequate honey pleasure of any form in his glass (like me). That said, this is a well-made, dry-ish quaffable golden bitter all the same.

review/text: Consumed at the Bistro's 10th Annual Double IPA Festival. Apricot pour with a frothy white head. Slight hop aroma but there is an almost medicine-like smell which is not good. Taste is very harsh. If rubbing alcohol had a taste, this might be it. Slight burning sensation on the sip as well. Drinkability is down right tough. Something is just not right with this batch.		Overall I really like the Pacific Coast beers, but this particular one was not on par with the others. Wasn't digging it.

review/text: This ale arrived at my table a deep copper color, head was thick and off-white. Lacing was spotty on the opposite side of the glass but thick on the mouth side. Aroma was not very strong but very inviting. Taste was slightly peppery and smooth. Hopping was with the Columbus variety. mouthfeel was rich and decadent. It also went down pretty well so drinkability is nice.	While I enjoyed this beer I thought the flavor lacked something and there was a slight bit of aftertaste I wasn't too nuts about. Maybe the brewers need a little work on their cask brewing or else it dosen't get as many calls due to ignorance. Still a good brew.

There is some toffee and caramel in terms of the malt character along with a bit of a chalkiness. To be honest, for a big beer like this, the nose is pretty mellow.		T: There's a decent bitterness on the palate along with some citrus hop flavor. Fairly decent malt character such as toffee, caramel, toast, and roast. There's an unfortunate cough syrup flavor in there too, though.		M: The body is medium and the carbonation is low to medium.		D: My first "Imperial Blue" Ale! But seriously...this wasn't all that great. Sadly, it was one of their better beers.

review/text: Sampled 5/3/2011 at the brewpub.		Pours pitch black, no light shining through, 1/2 inch off-white very creamy head that laces extremely well and lasts quite a while. 		Aroma is half chocolate and half roasted coffee but over all pretty light. Not as roast heavy as so many Irish stouts out there. 		Flavor is sweet and chocolatey, slightly acidic and roasty, but mostly very thin and watery. I also get some caramel and bread in the aftertaste. Very low bitterness despite the advertised 38 IBU. 		Body is very light and drinkable. 		c.

review/text: Sampled 5/3/2011 at the brewpub. 		This was made for the millennium originally but it's been made again, and who knows, in another decade it might be made yet again. So for now I've listed it as Rotating. As for the style, all I was told was that it's been "Burtonized" and it has some obvious oak influences. 		Pours clear, golden brown, small white head that doesnt lace or last. 		Aroma is wood, sweet, malt, and cherry. Kind of barleywine-ish.		Flavor is cherry, french oak, a little bit tart, caramel, plum, maybe some bready malts, some old hops (fish food), and low bitterness. 		Body is slgihtly more than medium, not a ton of CO2 but it works. Drinkable and enjoyable. 		c.

Flavor is honey, a touch of corn, some sweet malt, and a little grass, with that buttery background that the other beers seemed to all have. Slightly over hopped (flavor/aroma) blonde ale without much bitterness. 		Body is lightish, not real drinkable, more like a homebrew, but not overly offensive.		c.

review/text: On-tap at Pacific Coast		There's pretty much no information about this beer, and the woman serving us didn't seem to know anything about it either.		A: The pour is amber in color with almost no head. Maybe some scattered tan bubbles.		S: Hope you like diacetyl. The aroma is just completely overwhelmed by the movie theater butter and butterscotch notes. There are some citrus hops underneath as well, and maybe a little bit of pine.		T: The flavor starts off with quite a bit of alcohol but that is quickly covered up by the incredible butter intensity. More butterscotch than you'd ever care for here. There is a light bitterness to go along with a sort of sharp/abrasive citrus undertone.		M: The body is medium with a very low level of carbonation.		D: This was just awful. I've had some buttery beers before, but this was one of the worst. Don't get this beer.

review/text: On tap at the brewery. 		Chalice pour and I view a dirty brown ale with burgundy highlights throughout. The colors mesh very well together. Sweet candy aroma with some dark fruits in the mix. Malty taste with hints of plum. Slightly hoppy. Very full bodied. Almost chewy. Easy drink for a Barleywine and took me by surprise. Very drinkable though sipping tends to follow as more is consumed. Wish I could find this other than the brewery though this is worth searching out. Good stuff.

Well balanced grassiness but only faint ripe cherry notes. Bitterness starts getting astringent as it warms. Limited drinkability. Finish is boozy and dry, grassy, and a little oaky.

review/text: On tap at the brewpub pouring up clear deep copper with thin white head. The aroma is sweet with plums, raisins and some maltiness in the background. The taste begins with a pulse of roasty malts and then moving toward prunes, plums and raisins. It stays pretty dark and fruity into the finish providing a smooth experience. This one should only improve with some more cellar time.

review/text: Thank you again Ratman, for the opportunity to taste a memory. I remember trips to Pacific Coast back in the late nineties, but this is the first time in years I have seen a bottle from the brewery. A few years old, the bottle pours a somewhat hazy dark brown color. Dark fruits, caramel and oxidation on the nose, and not much different taste-wise. Memory says this was a pretty decent beer, and I think memory is probably correct.

review/text: '99 vintage. A still dark brown ale that poured still. The nose was powerful and pleasant. Wow what a taste! Great flavors of malt, alcohol, malt and a citrus hop bitterness. What makes this beer stand out is its rich, thickness forcing the bubbles to fight to the surface. This is my last bottle of this vintage. Too bad.

review/text: A friend of mine brought a growler down from PCB after I recommended the place to him. All of the other beers I had on my previous trip were good. This porter was one of my least favs.		Keep in mind tis growler is a few days old.Poured a deep brown, minimal tan head and still a slight bit of carbonation. Nose was some chocolate and roastiness. Taste was roasted and chocolate malt. Mouthfeel was nice and roasty but nothing more.

review/text: On-tap at Pacific Coast		A: The pour is nearly black, maybe just a really dark brown color with a small tan head.		S: Lots of things going on here. I get licorice, molasses, prunes (and other dark fruits), just to begin with. Also lots of roasted character and maybe a little bit of ash/burnt sugar. The nose is pretty sweet overall, though.		T: The flavor is somewhat harsh at times, but compared to the other beers these guys make, this is a winner. A bitter roasted malt flavor, prunes, molasses, licorice, and certainly some alcohol.		M: The body is medium with a low to moderate level of carbonation.		D: Not really my favorite take on an imperial stout, but it's a lot better than the other stuff they brew.

But I wam not blown away with taste. 		Drinkability is high with a smooth finish. They have as smooth a beer as it gets but sometimes that mean lack of taste. 		To bad

review/text: Source/Serving: Draft		Smell: Nice rich, sweet caramelized coffee liquor, coffee beans, and some light charred wood notes. Definite chocolate in the background. Quite sweet overall with moderate roastiness.		Taste: Smooth and dry with moderate bitterness. Not overwhelmingly roasty...more subtle with a good mix of coffee and chocolate. In the middle sweet malts come through with a nice sweet woodiness. Towards the finish the dries out the palette with some bourbon-like notes, more wood, and some grassy bitterness kicks in. Finish is quite dry and bitter with coffee bean bitterness that does sweeten up slightly as it lingers.		Notes: Overall the flavors are nice, but not exceptional. However, quite enjoyable and on the easy to drink side for an imperial stout.

review/text: On-tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a beautifully creamy head that leaves some lacing as well. Smells lightly roasty and quite creamy with a touch of red fruit. Tastes similar- roasty and creamy with just a hint of red and black fruit to keep it juicy and interesting. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth and seems a bit on the lighter side. Perilously drinkable given the high abv. I enjoyed this more than some of their others I've had in the past.

review/text: Stopped in to this brewpub in downtown Oakland. Beer was poured from a nitro-tap and was served in small snifter-type glass. It was inky black w/little carbonation and thin but lasting head. Taste was classic imperial stout - heavy hop bitterness, bitter chocolate and dry finish w/ warming alcohol. I only had one.

review/text: Poured from the nitro tap at the brewery into a goblet. Dark red to black in color, with a two third-inch ring of foam that lasted the entire time and remained in the glass when the beer was gone. Nice lace, as well. A spicy, roasty, and malty aroma with cocoa powder coming through loud and clear. The taste followed suit  lots of cocoa, roast, dark malt, and yeast or hops sneaking in at the end to round it out. Mouthfeel was very good with the aid of the nitro tap. Just a dandy Imperial Stout.

review/text: On-tap at Pacific Coast		A: The pour is amber in color, not surprisingly, with a decent khaki colored head.		S: Not a very pleasant aroma, I must say. There's definitely some sweetness, which is the nicest thing I can say about this beer. There's some sweaty butt crack aroma and quite a bit of alcohol as well.		T: At least this doesn't taste like ass crack (at least, I don't think it does). Decently bitter with some grapefruit juice but also some cleaning solution (maybe lemon pledge?). A bit of toffee malt flavor, too.		M: The body is medium and so is the carbonation.		D: Just bad. I had thought that the Grey Whale and Megalodon were the bottom of the barrel, but this is certainly in the running.
